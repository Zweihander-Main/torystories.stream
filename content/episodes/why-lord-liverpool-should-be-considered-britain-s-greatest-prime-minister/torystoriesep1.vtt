00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.430
<v 0>My name is Martin Hutchinson,</v>

2
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.050
and I welcome you to the inaugural Tory Stories podcast.

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.120
This series seeks to act as a modest counter to the almost

4
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:21.560
universal Whig version of history, observing history in the world,

5
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.740
from the point of view of an 18th century Tory.

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.390
Its particular focus will be on the industrial

7
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:32.000
revolution and the Tory achievements of 1660 -

8
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.490
1832.

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.560
Some of these will be based on books I've written such as the recently

10
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:43.670
released Britain's Greatest Prime Minister: Lord Liverpool.

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.860
However others will be from research for future titles as well as

12
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:53.120
relevant anecdotes I come across. Without further ado,

13
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.370
Tory Stories One:

14
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.380
Why Lord Liverpool should be considered Britain's Greatest Prime Minister.

15
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.940
This podcast will examine the achievements of Robert Banks Jenkinson

16
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.770
Second Earl of Liverpool Prime Minister from 1812 to 1827.

17
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:14.060
A subsequent podcast will indulge in the

18
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:18.530
comparative league table exercise of comparing him with other prime

19
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:21.200
ministers. In this podcast,

20
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.830
I will go through Liverpool's major achievements, one by one.

21
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.100
First he organized and strategized Napoleonic wars

22
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:34.640
victory. At the highest strategic level,

23
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.110
Liverpool made one call that proved crucial to the war success.

24
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.210
He outlined the rationale for application of steady and moderate

25
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:49.130
force by which Napoleon's unstable gimcrack empire could

26
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:50.150
be brought down.

27
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.920
Previous leaders during the first second, third,

28
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:59.780
fourth and fifth coalitions had attempted to bring overwhelming force

29
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:04.760
against France and Napoleon through a coalition of allied powers to defeat

30
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:09.140
him in one campaign. This brought repeated failure,

31
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.890
largely because in a single campaign,

32
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.050
Napoleon was a better general than anyone the allies could muster and the

33
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:22.820
theoretically superior allied forces were weakened by lack of

34
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:25.520
coordination between the different powers,

35
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.490
enabling them to be attacked piecemeal.

36
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.340
Liverpool reasoned that Britain had a stronger and more advanced economy than

37
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.633
France, her

38
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:41.000
ability to raise money without causing a financial crisis was much greater.

39
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.220
And her ability to call on the resources of the world through maritime trade

40
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.140
was infinitely greater and was increased still further by

41
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.580
Naval and colonial victories during Liverpool's period at the war office. The

42
00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:02.350
economy of Napoleon's empire relied excessively on looting

43
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.380
the non-French territories under his control,

44
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.150
which could work for only a limited time before their economic collapse left him

45
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:11.110
nothing further to loot.

46
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:15.520
Hence moderate pressure requiring Napolean

47
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:20.770
to expend military and other resources to combat it would over

48
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:25.150
time caused Napoleon's overextended empire to collapse.

49
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.300
Napoleon's invasion of Russia was an attempt to gain additional

50
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:34.600
resources to overcome this weakness.

51
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.710
When that failed his resources were fatally weakened,

52
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.630
and an allied coalition,

53
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.740
if assembled carefully and well-managed might finally succeed.

54
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.040
Liverpool's management of the economy to achieve victory was a close run thing.

55
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.590
In June,

56
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.180
1813 he and Nicholas Vansittart the Chancellor of the Exchequer

57
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.070
had several begging meetings at the Bank of England to extend the maturity of

58
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:04.240
treasury bills.

59
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.120
But once news of Wellington's victory at Vitoria reached London in

60
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:14.770
early July, markets got easier and financial stability was assured.

61
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.220
In 1813,

62
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.750
Liverpool with Castlereagh assembled the coalition could bring

63
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:27.160
enough military superiority to bear on defeating Napolean.

64
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.860
The October 1813 Battle of Leipzig without

65
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:34.720
significant British forces,

66
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:39.580
but with almost all allied powers heavily subsidized by Britain's

67
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:44.290
strong treasury was the triumph even more than Waterloo,

68
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.230
that changed the history of the 19th century.

69
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.890
And later for the Waterloo campaign,

70
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.490
Napoleon raised 17 million francs.

71
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.670
That was about 700,000 pounds,

72
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.980
but Vansittart by a bond issue on the 14th of June

73
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.690
four days before Waterloo raised 27 million

74
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:10.090
pounds, nearly 40 times as much.

75
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.340
The financial contest had become completely one-sided. Liverpool's

76
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.110
second achievement was to manage a peace settlement that lasted 99 years.

77
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.170
The 1814-15 Congress of Vienna and its peace

78
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:32.220
settlement have generally been given a good press by historians,

79
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.520
especially in light of the lamentable failure of The

80
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:41.010
1919 Congress of Versailles, which forgot several lessons taught

81
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.100
by Vienna.

82
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:48.990
The territorial adjustments brought 99 years without a general war

83
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.831
European war.

84
00:05:49.831 --> 00:05:54.720
While the quadruple or Holy Alliance set up some principles

85
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:58.310
of foreign policy that are still applicable today.

86
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:03.380
Credit for the success of the Congress generally goes to Metternich and

87
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.131
Castlereagh,

88
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.900
but the overall British strategy for a peace without the usual

89
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:13.280
spoils of victory was set up by Liverpool in a house

90
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.920
of Lords speech of November 1813.

91
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:23.330
British negotiating positions were agreed by Liverpool and Castlereagh

92
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.160
before Castlereagh's departure for Vienna and in several letters of guidance to

93
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.770
Castlereagh during the negotiations.

94
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:34.790
Liverpool was Castlereagh's boss throughout Castlereagh's tenure as foreign

95
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.770
minister, and, played a more detailed part in determining diplomatic

96
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:44.150
strategy and tactics that he did with Wellington in determining military

97
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:45.620
strategy and tactics.

98
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.410
Liverpool also played a full part in the successful and rapid

99
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:56.030
reintegration of France into the international concert of

100
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:58.160
nations after 1815,

101
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.650
facilitating the series of large financings in 1817 to 18,

102
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:04.840
that enabled it to happen.

103
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.640
Liverpool's third achievement was that he directed the British economy

104
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.380
through the industrial revolution.

105
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.140
Liverpool was prime minister when the British economy was going through changes

106
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.400
both unprecedented and unequaled in world history. Jean-Baptiste Say, the

107
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:31.750
French economist traveling through Britain in the autumn of

108
00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:35.890
1814, described his surprise,

109
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.380
at the plethora of steam engines being used in all kinds of applications,

110
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.150
a liberation from the limitations of naturally occurring power sources that had

111
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.930
been absent

112
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:52.630
in his previous visit a generation before, before the war had started.

113
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.230
In addition, the period 1815 to 20,

114
00:07:56.231 --> 00:08:00.910
saw massive economic disruption caused by the end of two

115
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:02.200
decades of war,

116
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.810
the largest natural failure of the European harvest in 1816

117
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.210
and a savage monetary deflation caused by the return to gold in 1819.

118
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.190
Liverpool was well aware of the effect of economic factors.

119
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.140
He had a superior economic education from his father,

120
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.430
Charles Jenkinson,

121
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.170
and he had Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo advising him.

122
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.560
Liverpool and Vansittart freed the British private sector to

123
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:40.210
compete by cutting non-interest public spending by

124
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:43.600
around 15% of GDP over the three years,

125
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.370
1814 to 17.

126
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.280
After an inevitable period of post-war retrenchment lasting two

127
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.114
years,

128
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.180
and exacerbated by 1816's year without a summer caused

129
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:59.430
by the Mount Tambora volcano,

130
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.950
the economy recovered rapidly in the second half of 1817, and 1818.

131
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:10.410
There was then a second downturn probably caused mainly by the sharp

132
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.120
deflation surrounding the 1819 to 21 return to the gold

133
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:20.040
standard after which the economy took off producing levels of real

134
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:24.000
economic growth never before seen. Overall,

135
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:28.710
the Liverpool years saw substantial growth in the British economy and a

136
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.160
significant improvement in real per capita incomes,

137
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.490
despite the period's rapid population growth,

138
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.090
that population growth being the fastest in British history.

139
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.150
Liverpool's budgetary, monetary, regulatory, and trade policy were

140
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.490
All important factors in this success.

141
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:52.410
The structure of government financing provided an

142
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:55.860
important additional boost to the 1820s economy.

143
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.810
As yields on existing government debt rose during war time,

144
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.770
instead of issuing new debt, bearing a higher interest coupon,

145
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.750
the government had issued 3% bonds with a deep discount often at

146
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:12.030
little more than 50% of par.

147
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.440
When peace returned and the government ran a budget surplus,

148
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.600
Britain's credit rating improved providing investors with large capital

149
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:25.020
gains, some 70% of GDP overall. These

150
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:31.920
capital gain profits provided the capital that financed Britain's industrial

151
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.750
takeoff, enabling the economy to become more capital-intensive,

152
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:41.580
which it needed to do without more than modest erosion of labor's share of

153
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.470
GDP. And the next achievement

154
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.320
was that Liverpool managed the social unrest of 1816 to 1820.

155
00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:52.340
EP

156
00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:58.190
Thompson in the making of the English working class,

157
00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:01.640
which is a classic book written in 1963,

158
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.220
paid tribute to Liverpool and his contemporaries.

159
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:08.840
"One is impressed with the extraordinary

160
00:11:08.841 --> 00:11:12.890
skill with which government between 1792 and

161
00:11:12.891 --> 00:11:17.540
1820 succeeded in forestalling serious

162
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:22.220
revolutionary developments and in maintaining a steady flow of

163
00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:25.370
reliable information as to

164
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.500
insurrectionary conspiracies." That's what Thompson said.

165
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.080
The early phase of industrialization put unprecedented strains on the social

166
00:11:36.081 --> 00:11:36.914
fabric.

167
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.350
For Britain to industrialize resources had to be diverted from labor to

168
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:45.860
capital, and that exerted downward pressure on wage rates. Moreover as

169
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:51.260
Say discovered on his 1814 visit to England,

170
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.650
at the end of the wars government debt and taxation placed another

171
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:58.960
unprecedented burden on the economy.

172
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.570
Several large groups of workers, such as handloom weavers,

173
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.050
stocking fame knitters, and croppers,

174
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.850
all outworkers paid by the piece and largely independent of their

175
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:17.620
employer were sharply immiserated during this period

176
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.330
by competition from factory based machinery and were consequently

177
00:12:22.331 --> 00:12:25.900
radicalized. Their wages were going down and down,

178
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:27.550
so of course they became radicals.

179
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.400
The result was an outbreak of machine breaking; Luddism in 1811-12

180
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.870
after the bad harvest of 1811,

181
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.000
and then two periods of national unrest with plots to overthrow the governments

182
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.830
by force in early 1817, and 1819 to 20,

183
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.950
when economic conditions were especially harsh. Liverpool

184
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.970
And Sidmouth, his home secretary,

185
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.590
made active use of informers to detect widespread conspiracies,

186
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.350
pass strong legislation, much of it,

187
00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:05.650
temporary to deter subversive activity,

188
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.750
but enforce the legislation mildly to avoid making discontent worse.

189
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.690
Two additional factors, softened social discontent, first Liverpool,

190
00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:21.190
and Sidmouth accepted the inefficiencies of outdoor relief,

191
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.160
the system under the Elizabethan Poor law,

192
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.530
and did not attempt to impose a system of workhouses as the Whigs would later

193
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:32.080
impose through the 1834 Poor law.

194
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.230
Second Liverpool recognized that organized religion and the Church of England

195
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:42.940
were important factors in improving the behavior and lessening the misery of the

196
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:46.090
impoverished. The church buildings act of 1818

197
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:49.900
and 1824,

198
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.280
thus subsidized the building of hundreds of churches in industrial areas,

199
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.760
which became important influences for social peace.

200
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:03.640
One of Liverpool's key objectives was to avoid the creation of

201
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:08.080
the anti-government working class consciousness that Thompson celebrates.

202
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.230
It was a close run thing, but he succeeded.

203
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.330
After 1819 working class radicalism first

204
00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:21.160
diverted to the defense of Queen Caroline in the 1820

205
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:25.870
agitation, and then died down through the prosperous 1820s.

206
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.720
Only in 1831-32 after Liverpool's departure did a true

207
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:36.550
working class consciousness arise as the Whigs encouraged radical

208
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:40.360
agitation in favor of their gerrymandering reform bill,

209
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:43.150
which indeed did nothing for the working classes.

210
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.040
Liverpool's next achievement, Number five:

211
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.820
he brought down without default or inflation the highest debt

212
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.743
ever.

213
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.790
There have been three occasions on which a major nation's government debt has

214
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:01.340
reached 250% of GDP.

215
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.310
Two in Britain after the Napoleonic wars and after world war two and one

216
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:08.480
in Japan today.

217
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:14.360
Of the three only Britain in Liverpool's time brought the debt down

218
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:18.260
without default, rescheduling or violent inflation.

219
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.390
At first glance,

220
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:23.750
the British government's of Clement Attlee through roughly Edward Heath were

221
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.320
even more successful in the forties through the seventies,

222
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:32.360
reducing public debt from 250% of GDP to around 50% of

223
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:35.030
GDP in 30 years. However,

224
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:39.290
they achieved this by keeping interest rates at artificially low levels and

225
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:43.160
allowing inflation to run into the middle or high single digits for several

226
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:46.820
decades peaking at 24% in

227
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.380
1975.

228
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.600
Holding government bonds in 1947 to 75 was roughly

229
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:57.290
equivalent to handloom weaving in the early industrial revolution.

230
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.250
It was completely futile and counter-productive activity.

231
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.910
This decapitalized, the British economy,

232
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.990
destroyed middle-class savings and made Britain's economic performance far

233
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.050
inferior to those of its competitors.

234
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.620
Everybody else had an economic miracle, but Britain didn't.

235
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:21.110
The Liverpool government's first step after hostility ceased in 1815

236
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.880
was to stabilize the debt position through budget stringency.

237
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.510
This is one of the Liverpool government's greatest achievements.

238
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:35.240
Liverpool's next step was to restore full confidence in Britain's credit by

239
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:40.010
returning to the gold standard, which was achieved in 1819 to 21.

240
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:45.500
Initially this was massively deflationary and increased the burden of government

241
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:49.550
debt in terms of GDP. It also produced a savage,

242
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.930
but brief secondary reccession dip in 1819 to spring of

243
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:54.950
1820.

244
00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.470
However from 1819 on Britain's credit was undoubted as was the

245
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:02.870
value of the currency in its purchasing power.

246
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.700
Government debt was reduced without deflation from

247
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:11.720
260% of GDP in 1819 to

248
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.110
192% of GDP when Liverpool left office in 1827 on its way to

249
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:22.490
below a hundred percent of GDP by the 1850s,

250
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:27.020
when Gladstone became a supposedly brilliant chancellor of the Exchequer; my

251
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:30.530
view is he had it very easy.

252
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:38.630
Sixth, Liverpool designed two corn laws and began the move towards free

253
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:39.464
trade.

254
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.050
The 1815 corn laws were a legislative compromise,

255
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.800
designed to cushion the effect on landowners of the transition from war to peace

256
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.470
in which grain prices would decline and international competition intensify.

257
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.760
Part of their rationale was strategic rather than economic.

258
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.250
Liverpool's government wanted Britain whose population was rising rapidly

259
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.780
to be as far as possible self-sufficient in foodstuffs in a war.

260
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.420
The corn laws had an additional rationale in making it economically

261
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:17.790
attractive to grow corn in Ireland.

262
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.020
Thus partially weaning the Irish from dependence on the potato monoculture.

263
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.480
The Irish corn production,

264
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:28.740
so developed would mitigate the awful tragedy of the

265
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:33.360
1840s Irish potato famine, although alas not by very much.

266
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.740
By the mid 1820s, the corn laws had become too restrictive. Corn

267
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:44.130
prices had declined by two thirds leading to a massive depression in the

268
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:47.250
agricultural sector in 1822 - 23.

269
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.050
Prices in general had declined by about 40% with the return to gold,

270
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:57.040
so the 80 shillings per quarter hard limit in the 1815

271
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.190
law was higher than grain prices were like to do reach in anything but the worst

272
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.191
years.

273
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:07.080
Hence Liverpool with Huskisson designed a new sliding

274
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:11.640
scale corn law that reduced protection as prices rose with a

275
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:14.640
fulcrum around 60 shillings per quarter.

276
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.390
Regrettably Liverpool suffered his stroke before being able to introduce this

277
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.640
and the eventual legislation of 1828 while based on the Liverpool

278
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.590
Huskisson draft was both more protectionist and less market friendly

279
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:36.210
being subject to manipulation by corn suppliers. However,

280
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.350
any reasonably designed corn law would have prevented much agricultural distress

281
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:44.670
had it still been in force after 1873.

282
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Once the shipping across the Atlantic and the railway system

283
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.090
in America became operational, there

284
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:55.890
was no way British agriculture was competitive.

285
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.190
The campaign for free trade,

286
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:03.300
which dominated the political world in the Cobden-Chevalier treaty of

287
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:07.950
1860 was begun by the 1820 house of Lords

288
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:12.930
debate in which Lansdowne the Whig leader and Liverpool outlined

289
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.590
the case for easing and removing trade restrictions.

290
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:22.500
Liverpool then presided over a repeated series of tariff cuts and

291
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:26.970
trade liberating measures designed in detail by Huskisson,

292
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.280
Robinson and Thomas Wallace.

293
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:34.350
This removal of restrictions was a significant contributor to the prosperity of

294
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:36.330
1820s. However,

295
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:41.130
Liverpool did not favor the unilateral free trade policies followed

296
00:20:41.131 --> 00:20:43.050
after 1846,

297
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.860
which hollowed out British competitiveness because they allowed other countries

298
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:52.690
to undercut British exports worldwide.

299
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:59.770
Number seven achievement Liverpool took Britain back onto the gold standard

300
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:02.020
against strong political opposition.

301
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:09.910
Britain's return to the gold standard enacted in 1819 and completed

302
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:12.880
in 1821 was a brave decision.

303
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.460
It added about 40% to the real value of Britain's heavy outstanding debt

304
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.980
burdening future generations.

305
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.590
It damaged the fortunes of the politically powerful country gentry who'd

306
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:30.610
borrowed excessively during the war based on high grain prices.

307
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.310
It produced a short second recessionary dip in the economy leading to

308
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:39.970
widespread unrest and including the Peterloo massacre.

309
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.760
Yet the decision reestablished British credit on rock solid

310
00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:50.620
foundations and allowed interest rates to remain low and capital

311
00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:54.160
values correspondingly high for the remainder of the century.

312
00:21:55.270 --> 00:22:00.010
While later legislative meddling deprived it of the automaticity of a

313
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:01.750
truly free market monetary system,

314
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.100
the 19th century gold standard was quite close to this

315
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:06.934
ideal.

316
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.190
It led to London dominating the world's financial system for the next century

317
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.240
with incomparable benefits to British trade and the economy in general.

318
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.620
While the monetary system established by Liverpool wasn't perfect,

319
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:22.240
we've yet to find a better one.

320
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.240
Liverpool performed a useful additional service for the British economy in

321
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:31.720
stabilizing the coinage by his re coinage of

322
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:33.610
1816-17,

323
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.620
which was along the lines designed by his father 20 years earlier.

324
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.460
Number eight, Liverpool ended with a vigorous period of social reform.

325
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.220
By his restructuring of 1821-23 in the cabinet,

326
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.400
Liverpool changed the nature of his government.

327
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.540
One such change was forced by Castlereagh's suicide,

328
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.740
and Liverpool's determination to replace him with Canning his old friend from

329
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:03.730
Oxford days.

330
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.860
However that change Sidmouth's replacement by Peel and Vansittart's

331
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:14.620
replacement by Robinson all replaced highly effective and strong

332
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:19.600
if unpopular ministers with successors who were considerably more

333
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.880
Whig historian friendly,

334
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.840
which is why the last part of Liverpool's government has a better reputation

335
00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:26.950
than the earlier parts.

336
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.360
The last five years of Liverpool's government produced a high level of

337
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:35.800
achievement on several fronts, which has been celebrated by posterity.

338
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.320
Even William Gladstone is alleged to have said "England was never better

339
00:23:41.321 --> 00:23:44.740
governed then between 1822 and 1830". Economically,

340
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.860
the government lowered taxation,

341
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.540
made substantial moves towards free trade and produced an economic

342
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:57.080
upsurge that marked the take-off stage of the industrial revolution.

343
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.180
In foreign policy,

344
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:03.410
the government abandoned Castlereagh's system of European alliances for

345
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:05.900
Canning's policy of isolation and global assertion;

346
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:10.130
a policy that remained in force for the rest of the century.

347
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:15.770
In domestic policy Peel undertook a massive program of legal and

348
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:20.540
social reform that modernized British society and laid the foundation for the

349
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:21.770
Victorian age.

350
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.180
Then finally, Liverpool reformed the English banking system. The

351
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:35.660
English banking system before 1825 was flawed making it

352
00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:39.830
both unstable and incompatible with the gold standard monetary

353
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:42.410
framework. Except for the bank of England,

354
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:45.410
no bank could have more than six partners.

355
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.990
So the were by 1825,

356
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:52.430
over 800 country banks and no large banks of undoubted

357
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:53.264
stability.

358
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.180
Liverpool recognized that the most critical function of banks was to act as

359
00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:00.800
safe havens for money,

360
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.760
especially for poor citizens who had few alternatives.

361
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.100
By the savings bank act of 1817,

362
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.710
he established trustee savings banks administered by

363
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:13.730
trustees,

364
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.530
which could invest only in government securities and deposits at the bank of

365
00:25:18.531 --> 00:25:19.364
England.

366
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.860
This provided an absolute haven for savings secure from the vagaries

367
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:25.970
of the loan market.

368
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.280
Trustee savings banks lasted until the 1980s and even by

369
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:32.750
1825,

370
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:38.480
they had total deposits of 13.3 million more than the

371
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.000
stamped country bank notes worth 8.8 million that caused so much trouble in the

372
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:45.680
financial crash of that year.

373
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.030
With the conventional English banking system unsound,

374
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.910
the 1825 crisis was inevitable and was predicted by Liverpool eight

375
00:25:55.911 --> 00:26:00.560
months before it broke. The crisis was caused by speculation,

376
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:05.870
much of it encourage by over issue of one pound and two pound notes by the

377
00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:06.860
country banks.

378
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:12.050
Gold flowed out of the country to return only when the bank of England sharply

379
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:16.070
increased interest rates. This led to a wave of bank failures.

380
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.010
In January, 1826,

381
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.070
Liverpool presented a paper to the bank of England,

382
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.630
outlining a banking reform that was essentially adopted in toto.

383
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:32.150
This reform made the English banking system based on the gold standard secure

384
00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:36.410
for the rest of the century with only one major bank failure that of Overend,

385
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.080
and Gurney in 1866.

386
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:43.980
Finally Liverpool led an outstandingly able government,

387
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:45.120
including six prime ministers. His

388
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:51.420
government included Sidmouth previously known as Addington Canning

389
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.460
Robinson later known as Goderich, Wellington Peel and Palmerston.

390
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.450
In addition, he had negotiations with Grenville in 1818, he used

391
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:06.540
Aberdeen as a diplomat and his principle leftenant was Castlereagh who was

392
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:11.010
unquestionably of prime ministerial caliber. Eldon,

393
00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:15.480
Bathurst, Melville Huskisson and Copley later Lord Lyndhurst,

394
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.980
were all notably successful ministers in their respective departments.

395
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.280
So in conclusion,

396
00:27:23.281 --> 00:27:27.900
that is a long list of substantial achievements and they were made not in the

397
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:30.000
placid mid 19th century,

398
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.180
nor in the declining mid 20th century,

399
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.530
but at the time of Britain's greatest strategic and economic dominance,

400
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.750
when there was a hell of a lot going on.

401
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.980
Looked at dispassionately without Whigish prejudices,

402
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.570
there should really be no doubt:

403
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.370
Liverpool was Britain's Greatest Prime Minister. Thank You very much.

404
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:51.810
That is the end of Tory Story podcast number one.
