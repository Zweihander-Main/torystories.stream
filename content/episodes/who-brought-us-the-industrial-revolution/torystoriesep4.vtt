00:05.190 --> 00:11.471
These Tory Stories podcasts aim to act as counters to the universal Whig version of

2
00:11.495 --> 00:16.482
history. They observe history and the world from the viewpoint of an 18th

3
00:16.506 --> 00:23.088
Century Tory. Their focus will be on the Industrial Revolution and the Tory

4
00:23.112 --> 00:26.691
achievements of 1660-1832.

5
00:26.715 --> 00:32.427
Tory Story IV – Who brought us the Industrial Revolution?

6
00:32.451 --> 00:38.627
In this Tory Story I want to look at those who brought us the Industrial Revolution.

7
00:38.651 --> 00:42.279
They were the most important generators of this greatest

8
00:42.303 --> 00:45.385
civilizational advance in world history.

9
00:45.409 --> 00:49.626
Everybody has heard of James Watt, but was he really the catalyst?

10
00:49.650 --> 00:52.213
(I will argue: no.)

11
00:52.237 --> 00:55.167
There is no single answer to this question.

12
00:55.191 --> 01:00.172
There are however around 20 people who played distinctive roles in the process.

13
01:00.196 --> 01:04.169
Only some were inventors, and those in several different fields.

14
01:04.193 --> 01:06.406
Some were industrialists.

15
01:06.430 --> 01:11.450
Some were scientists, who invented the ideas on which the Industrial Revolution

16
01:11.474 --> 01:16.737
was built. Finally, there were a few enlightened statesmen, who put in place

17
01:16.761 --> 01:21.839
legislation that assisted the process, moving Britain and the world towards a

18
01:21.863 --> 01:24.544
future that they could only dimly discern.

19
01:24.568 --> 01:31.473
To begin with, I look at the figures from the 17th century, who put in place

20
01:31.497 --> 01:33.456
important preconditions for

21
01:33.480 --> 01:35.948
an Industiral Revolution that

22
01:35.972 --> 01:37.414
had not yet begun to happen.

23
01:37.438 --> 01:42.298
Without their work, industrialization would not have happened, or at least it

24
01:42.322 --> 01:44.120
would not have happened in Britain.

25
01:44.144 --> 01:49.198
We might call them, not fathers but grandfathers of the Industrial Revolution.

26
01:49.222 --> 01:55.304
The earliest grandfather was a polymath lawyer, Francis Bacon.

27
01:55.328 --> 02:00.142
Bacon had two major contributions towards Britain’s industrialization.

28
02:00.166 --> 02:06.849
The more important was the Scientific Method, propounded in his 1620 treatise,

29
02:06.873 --> 02:14.127
“Novum Organum Scientiarum.” Bacon’s method of induction involved building a

30
02:14.151 --> 02:19.303
theory of general axioms based on particular observed cases and then testing

31
02:19.327 --> 02:22.510
that theory through further experimentation.

32
02:22.534 --> 02:28.525
Each set of axioms could then be built upon to create more general axioms,

33
02:28.549 --> 02:35.520
building the scientific edifice on a solid foundation of experimental observation.

34
02:35.544 --> 02:43.159
This iterative combination of intellectual reasoning and experimentation was

35
02:43.183 --> 02:49.576
essential for the scientific, technological and engineering work that

36
02:49.600 --> 02:54.703
produced industrialization. Others had come close to it before Bacon, but he

37
02:54.727 --> 02:58.933
systematized it and made it a widespread intellectual paradigm.

38
02:58.957 --> 03:07.881
Bacon’s other major contribution was to tell James I while Lord Chancellor that

39
03:07.905 --> 03:14.104
substantial forced emigration of British indentured servants brought double

40
03:14.128 --> 03:19.423
benefits: “the avoidance of people here, and in making use of them there.” That

41
03:19.447 --> 03:26.082
raised British wages (at a time when they were near a 300-year low) and made Britain

42
03:26.106 --> 03:30.917
the dominant colonist in North America and the Caribbean, producing immensely

43
03:30.941 --> 03:36.882
profitable taxable crops of tobacco and sugar that financed both the era’s wars

44
03:36.906 --> 03:39.114
and industrialization itself.

45
03:39.138 --> 03:46.011
Other lawyers were also important in establishing a firm foundation for the

46
03:46.035 --> 03:51.616
Industrial Revolution, in particular rock-sold property rights, equality before

47
03:51.640 --> 03:56.238
the law between the well-connected and the obscure and patent rights.

48
03:56.262 --> 04:03.877
In the 17th century, Edward Coke, John Selden and Sir Matthew Hale all played

49
04:03.901 --> 04:08.240
roles in establishing these legal principles fully independent of the Crown

50
04:08.264 --> 04:10.127
(and, therefore, of the state).

51
04:10.151 --> 04:16.047
In the following century, Sir Edward Blackstone codified English common law,

52
04:16.071 --> 04:21.713
thereby making it readily comprehensible for ordinary people, and not a specialized

53
04:21.737 --> 04:25.001
arcana that only lawyers could penetrate.

54
04:25.025 --> 04:33.029
Bacon was also the inspiration for the Royal Society, founded in 1662 as what he

55
04:33.053 --> 04:36.023
called a “House of Solomon” for scientific wisdom.

56
04:36.047 --> 04:41.672
In its early years, the Royal Society became the leading entrepot of scientific

57
04:41.696 --> 04:47.685
wisdom in Europe, fostering both the Scientific Method and scientific knowledge

58
04:47.709 --> 04:55.014
itself. Its Restoration leaders, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren,

59
04:55.038 --> 05:01.433
John Flamsteed, Edmond Halley and above all Sir Isaac Newton made Britain a

60
05:01.457 --> 05:06.523
scientific, technological society, changing the way less eminent men were

61
05:06.547 --> 05:10.703
educated and thought about scientific and engineering advances.

62
05:10.727 --> 05:17.315
After 1700, the Royal Society succumbed to gentlemanly somnolence, but Newton and

63
05:17.339 --> 05:21.363
Halley survived to inspire their successors well into the new century.

64
05:21.387 --> 05:27.759
Apart from Newton, the Royal Society’s most important members for future

65
05:27.783 --> 05:33.939
industrialization were Robert Boyle, whose Boyle’s Law was central to steam power

66
05:33.963 --> 05:40.239
and Robert Hooke, whose work on springs and microscopy was no more important than

67
05:40.263 --> 05:41.507
his invention of the

68
05:41.531 --> 05:43.736
escapement and patronage of

69
05:43.760 --> 05:46.226
the clockmaker Thomas Tompion.

70
05:46.250 --> 05:52.213
Tompion, the first maker of precision clocks in Britain, made important advances

71
05:52.237 --> 05:58.056
in materials technology and fine engineering that became important both to

72
05:58.080 --> 06:02.969
John Harrison’s work on chronometers and to industrial machinery in general.

73
06:02.993 --> 06:10.323
In the Restoration era, the Royal Family was also important in preparing society

74
06:10.347 --> 06:16.320
for industrialization. Charles II ruled more strictly according to law than had

75
06:16.344 --> 06:22.706
his predecessors, forming a contrast to his absolutist Continental contemporaries

76
06:22.730 --> 06:27.350
and strengthening the system’s legal protections of property and enterprise.

77
06:27.374 --> 06:34.898
Charles II and James II still had a major role in economic policy, and after 1674

78
06:34.922 --> 06:40.738
avoided costly wars, allowing the new revenue sources from customs and excise

79
06:40.762 --> 06:46.944
duties on rapidly growing imports to bolster the nation’s finances while

80
06:46.968 --> 06:49.913
keeping taxation at a low and benign level.

81
06:49.937 --> 06:56.643
Their emphasis on trade and abandonment of the early Stuart creation of

82
06:56.667 --> 06:59.062
state-directed monopolies moved

83
06:59.086 --> 07:00.670
the economy substantially

84
07:00.694 --> 07:02.298
towards free markets.

85
07:02.322 --> 07:08.068
They also built up the Royal Navy while having only a modest standing army,

86
07:08.092 --> 07:14.635
pursuing an extra-European trade-oriented foreign policy that in the following

87
07:14.659 --> 07:18.344
century paid huge dividends in revenues and markets.

88
07:18.368 --> 07:26.731
Prince Rupert (Charles II’s first cousin and uncle of the future George I) played a

89
07:26.755 --> 07:33.124
major role in the Navy, in scientific innovation (Prince Rupert’s Drops) and in

90
07:33.148 --> 07:39.903
non-European expansion -- he was a founder in 1670 of the Hudson’s Bay Company,

91
07:39.927 --> 07:47.134
whose hinterland Prince Rupert’s Land was Britain’s largest colonial territory at

92
07:47.158 --> 07:50.132
1.49 million square miles.

93
07:50.156 --> 07:56.642
His encouragement of science, new knowledge and exploration signified the

94
07:56.666 --> 08:01.484
reorienting of Royal and political leadership towards functions that would

95
08:01.508 --> 08:03.686
benefit ordinary people.

96
08:03.710 --> 08:08.621
He also epitomised the Restoration’s “can-do” spirit that inspired the

97
08:08.645 --> 08:11.210
entrepreneurs of the following century.

98
08:11.234 --> 08:17.631
The 17th century was the most intellectually vibrant century the human

99
08:17.655 --> 08:23.714
race has ever enjoyed. Beyond Bacon and Newton, the century’s thinkers and

100
08:23.738 --> 08:28.548
statesmen produced advances in the social sciences that were vital both to

101
08:28.572 --> 08:32.023
industrialization and to our modern world in general.

102
08:32.047 --> 08:37.816
I talked in Tory Stories 2 of the Oxfordshire School of economists,

103
08:37.840 --> 08:44.068
descending from Lucius Cary 2nd Viscount Falkland’s Great Tew circle.

104
08:44.092 --> 08:50.225
They founded both a workable system of free-market economics and, in the Tory

105
08:50.249 --> 08:55.063
party, the political system that gave Britain industrialization itself.

106
08:55.087 --> 09:00.213
The central figure in this change was Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, whose

107
09:00.237 --> 09:03.517
Tenures Abolition Act 1660

108
09:03.541 --> 09:05.845
was the greatest single step

109
09:05.869 --> 09:07.831
towards industrialization.

110
09:07.855 --> 09:13.820
It set up a truly free market for land, enabling people to mortgage and sell it.

111
09:13.844 --> 09:17.624
That liquefied the British economy’s largest asset.

112
09:17.648 --> 09:24.332
The 17th century saw only preliminary moves towards industrialization itself.

113
09:24.356 --> 09:31.086
Dudd Dudley and Clement Clerke both produced iron from coke or coal,

114
09:31.554 --> 09:34.510
pre-dating Abraham Darby whose more famous),

115
09:34.534 --> 09:38.454
but their process was uneconomic, since forests were

116
09:38.478 --> 09:43.507
not yet so denuded as to make wood for charcoal a scarce resource.

117
09:43.531 --> 09:51.197
(The wars of 1689-1713, with their demand on wood for naval shipbuilding, would

118
09:51.221 --> 09:56.462
produce this necessary economic transition.) As for steam engines,

119
09:56.486 --> 10:04.777
Jeronomio de Ayanz y Beaumont had produced a steam pump in Spain in 1606, the

120
10:04.801 --> 10:12.658
Marquess of Worcester produced a design in 1655 and Thomas Savery patented one in in

121
10:12.682 --> 10:18.645
1698. All three of their designs were quite similar, all were very inefficient

122
10:18.669 --> 10:21.162
and none involved moving parts.

123
10:21.186 --> 10:25.557
Thus, the true inventor of the steam engine was Thomas Newcomen in the

124
10:25.581 --> 10:27.706
following century.

125
10:27.730 --> 10:33.715
Now I come onto the fathers of the Industrial Revolution, those who created

126
10:33.739 --> 10:40.161
it directly. Since steam engines were the central technology, we should first

127
10:40.185 --> 10:42.074
apportion the credit for them.

128
10:42.098 --> 10:47.912
The conventional wisdom is that steam engines were invented by James Watt and

129
10:47.936 --> 10:55.821
that the Industrial Revolution get started just as Watt’s rotary engine came on the

130
10:55.845 --> 10:58.731
market. That is wrong in both respects.

131
10:58.755 --> 11:05.031
I suggested in Tory Stories 3 that the Industrial Revolution took off about 15

132
11:05.055 --> 11:07.316
years before Watt’s rotary engine.

133
11:07.340 --> 11:13.954
Watt’s advances were important but formed only one stage, the second, of the three

134
11:13.978 --> 11:19.435
stages necessary to get to the railways, the definitive steam engine application.

135
11:19.459 --> 11:27.296
Thomas Newcomen, a Dartmouth ironmonger, began experimenting on steam engines about

136
11:27.320 --> 11:35.508
1703. His early experiments met with the same problem as had Savery’s pump – the

137
11:35.532 --> 11:40.613
steam would not cool fast enough for the engine to operate at a reasonable pace.

138
11:40.637 --> 11:48.298
However, on one of his experiments the cylinder was cracked, allowing a jet of

139
11:48.322 --> 11:53.375
water into the steam immediately, producing a fast and powerful stroke.

140
11:53.399 --> 11:56.086
Newcomen accordingly modified

141
11:56.110 --> 11:58.361
the design to inject a jet of

142
11:58.385 --> 12:00.602
water into the cylinder.

143
12:00.626 --> 12:07.238
After further experiments and an installation at the Wheal Vor tin mine

144
12:07.262 --> 12:12.222
that was not wholly satisfactory, Newcomen’s first successful “atmospheric

145
12:12.246 --> 12:19.261
engine,” powered by atmospheric pressure alone, was built at Dudley Castle in 1712.

146
12:19.285 --> 12:25.084
This was the first steam engine with moving parts, which functioned for at

147
12:25.108 --> 12:28.085
least 70 years pumping water out of a coal mine

148
12:28.109 --> 12:30.525
next to Dudley castle.

149
12:30.549 --> 12:36.107
Newcomen was forced to operate under Savery’s patent, but that had been

150
12:36.131 --> 12:43.725
extended to 1733, longer than any Newcomen patent taken out in say 1710 without an

151
12:43.749 --> 12:45.610
additional Act of Parliament.

152
12:45.634 --> 12:47.743
Patents were normally 14 years.

153
12:47.767 --> 12:55.432
Savery’s contacts may also have been helpful, but by 1715 when “The Proprietors

154
12:55.456 --> 13:01.515
of the Invention for Raising Water by Fire” was set up to raise money, Savery

155
13:01.539 --> 13:08.894
had died. “The Proprietors” raised about £20,000 divided into 80 shares, probably

156
13:08.918 --> 13:14.281
arranged by the “Hollow Sword Blade Company” later the sponsor of the South

157
13:14.305 --> 13:17.789
Sea Bubble and really the first merchant bank.

158
13:17.813 --> 13:22.496
Newcomen had a share in The Proprietors, but possibly only one.

159
13:22.520 --> 13:29.225
However, he made money from installations; of which there were 110 by 1733 when the

160
13:29.249 --> 13:36.028
patent expired compared with only 48 steam engines in France as late as 1816.

161
13:36.052 --> 13:42.471
“The Proprietors” shares were modestly profitable, paying £30 per share dividends

162
13:42.495 --> 13:48.942
in most of the patent’s 18 remaining years on an investment of about £250.

163
13:48.966 --> 13:52.937
Newcomen’s achievement should not be underestimated.

164
13:52.961 --> 13:58.735
He was working with Queen Anne-era metalworking standards, so pistons fit

165
13:58.759 --> 14:01.488
into cylinders only within an inch or so.

166
14:01.512 --> 14:07.479
His “atmospheric engines” were very thermally inefficient, one third of the

167
14:07.503 --> 14:12.478
efficiency of the later Watt engines, so they were most useful in coal mining

168
14:12.502 --> 14:16.251
districts, because coal was expensive and difficult to transport.

169
14:16.275 --> 14:22.610
Nevertheless, Newcomen engines were still being installed in the 1790s, to avoid the

170
14:22.634 --> 14:32.147
Watt patent, and by 1800 1,400 Newcomen engines had been installed, over 70% of

171
14:32.171 --> 14:37.124
total installations, compared with 496 Watt engines.

172
14:37.148 --> 14:43.331
It was Newcomen’s invention, two generations before Watt’s, that made steam

173
14:43.355 --> 14:46.825
engines an important part of Britain’s industrial landscape.

174
14:46.849 --> 14:52.745
If you date the Industrial Revolution by steam engines, it began in the reign of

175
14:52.769 --> 14:55.436
Queen Anne, not George III.

176
14:55.460 --> 15:03.118
James Watt trained as an instrument maker in London, before returning to Glasgow and

177
15:03.142 --> 15:08.203
setting up a small instrument-making workshop in Glasgow University.

178
15:08.227 --> 15:15.402
In 1763, Watt set out to repair a Newcomen engine owned by the university,

179
15:15.426 --> 15:17.536
discovering its inefficiencies.

180
15:17.560 --> 15:23.902
In 1765 he discovered that a separate condenser would greatly improve the

181
15:23.926 --> 15:28.625
engine’s efficiency, taking out a 14-year patent in 1769.

182
15:28.649 --> 15:34.204
He then formed a partnership with John Roebuck, himself an innovator in three

183
15:34.228 --> 15:39.663
quite separate industrial technologies, to construct a full-sized engine to pump out

184
15:39.687 --> 15:45.295
Roebuck’s mine but was still unable to make a sufficiently tightly machined

185
15:45.319 --> 15:52.138
cylinder. When Roebuck went bankrupt in 1772, Boulton bought his interest

186
15:52.162 --> 15:54.657
(that's Matthew Boulton) and Watt

187
15:54.681 --> 15:56.621
moved to Birmingham.

188
15:56.645 --> 16:02.880
The full partnership Boulton and Watt was formed in 1775, after Boulton had used his

189
16:02.904 --> 16:09.555
Parliamentary influence to extend the life of Watt’s patent from 1783 to 1800.

190
16:09.579 --> 16:15.756
Watt’s engine only became a major improvement on Newcomen’s with the use in

191
16:15.780 --> 16:18.657
1776 of a cylinder boring

192
16:18.681 --> 16:20.621
machine developed by the

193
16:20.645 --> 16:22.917
ironmaster John Wilkinson.

194
16:23.060 --> 16:29.098
Together with the condenser this achieved a threefold improvement in the engine’s

195
16:29.122 --> 16:33.768
thermal efficiency – John Smeaton calculated the “duty” of a Watt engine

196
16:33.792 --> 16:40.355
(the amount of water it could raise 1 foot using a bushel of coal) at 18.9 million

197
16:40.379 --> 16:44.212
pounds, compared to 5 million for a Newcomen engine.

198
16:44.236 --> 16:51.013
In 1783, Watt produced a rotary engine, which could be used to power machinery,

199
16:51.037 --> 16:55.637
but like Newcomen’s engine still relied on atmospheric pressure for power.

200
16:55.661 --> 17:00.234
Even after this invention, Watt’s engine was slow to catch on.

201
17:00.258 --> 17:05.485
Wilkinson bought the first engine and produced cylinders for Boulton &amp; Watt

202
17:05.509 --> 17:11.375
under contract; Samuel Whitbread, the brewer, bought the second, which was used

203
17:11.399 --> 17:13.291
as a London demonstration.

204
17:13.315 --> 17:20.617
However, the first textile mill to use a rotary Watt engine, at Papplewick in 1786,

205
17:20.641 --> 17:26.295
went bankrupt and Watt engines were not universal in the textile business even by

206
17:26.319 --> 17:32.308
1800. Their market penetration was however increased by Boulton’s aggressive

207
17:32.332 --> 17:34.632
exploitation of the Watt patent.

208
17:34.656 --> 17:37.576
Watt engines were a big

209
17:37.600 --> 17:39.467
advance on Newcomen, but

210
17:39.491 --> 17:41.576
still had severe limitations.

211
17:41.600 --> 17:48.072
Being “atmospheric” they had to be large, limiting their applicability in industry,

212
17:48.096 --> 17:53.027
and their power to weight ratio was insufficient to power railway engines.

213
17:53.051 --> 17:59.541
The next step required engines using steam at pressure of several atmospheres, now

214
17:59.565 --> 18:05.146
possible due to Wilkinson’s boring machine and new inventions in machine tools.

215
18:05.170 --> 18:12.091
The first “compound” engine, with a high-pressure cylinder and a low-pressure

216
18:12.115 --> 18:17.838
one, using the steam twice for maximum efficiency, developed by Jonathan

217
18:17.862 --> 18:23.252
Hornblower in 1781, could not be sold because of the Watt patent.

218
18:23.276 --> 18:32.429
Only after 1800 did high-pressure and compound engines become common, developed

219
18:32.453 --> 18:37.026
by Richard Trevithick, Arthur Woolf and Matthew Murray.

220
18:37.050 --> 18:45.339
Woolf’s “Cornish Engine” of around 1815 had a “duty” of 50 million pounds, almost

221
18:45.363 --> 18:49.698
three times that of the Watt engine -- it could thus have been used for railways.

222
18:49.722 --> 18:56.653
However, after demonstration models by Trevithick, it was Murray who in 1812

223
18:56.677 --> 19:04.029
produced the first commercially successful steam engine “Salamanca”, named after

224
19:04.053 --> 19:08.979
Wellington’s Peninsular War victory and deployed at the Middleton Colliery near

225
19:09.003 --> 19:15.251
Leeds. Following Salamanca’s success, other railway engine developers emerged,

226
19:15.275 --> 19:21.770
with George Stephenson developing the first railway services on the Stockton and

227
19:21.794 --> 19:27.636
Darlington Railway in 1825 and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830,

228
19:27.660 --> 19:31.517
using his engines “Locomotion” and “Rocket.”

229
19:31.541 --> 19:36.713
The Industrial Revolution involved a lot more than steam engines.

230
19:36.737 --> 19:42.631
For one thing, it required the development of an entirely new form of organization,

231
19:42.655 --> 19:48.757
the large factory with several hundred or even thousands of employees and an

232
19:48.781 --> 19:51.104
optimized workflow.

233
19:51.128 --> 19:57.693
The first of these was the ironworks developed by Sir Ambrose Crowley at

234
19:57.717 --> 20:03.775
Winlaton, Northumberland between 1691 and his death in 1713.

235
20:03.799 --> 20:11.129
Crowley, from a Midlands nail-making family, set up a nail works in Sunderland

236
20:11.153 --> 20:17.310
in 1682, where he could import bar iron from Sweden, a cheaper source of

237
20:17.334 --> 20:20.901
charcoal-fired iron because of its plentiful forests.

238
20:20.925 --> 20:26.891
By using a coastal site and distributing by ship through a London warehouse,

239
20:26.915 --> 20:33.285
Crowley acquired a substantial cost advantage over Midlands nailmakers, who

240
20:33.309 --> 20:35.797
had to use the era’s abominable roads.

241
20:35.821 --> 20:43.433
In 1691 he shifted operations to rural Winlaton, probably because his Catholic

242
20:43.457 --> 20:49.868
specialist nailmakers from Liege were harassed by Sunderland’s Whig mobs.

243
20:50.100 --> 20:58.597
At Winlaton and nearby Swalwell, Crowley built an integrated ironworks with over

244
20:58.621 --> 21:05.446
1,000 employees and tight quality control that became the Navy’s largest supplier.

245
21:05.470 --> 21:11.792
Crowley himself remained in London, overseeing marketing and distribution and

246
21:11.816 --> 21:19.794
becoming Sheriff of the City of London and a Tory MP, but instituted a “Law Book of

247
21:19.818 --> 21:26.523
the Crowley Iron Works” that included a welfare plan and HR practices more typical

248
21:26.547 --> 21:29.110
of the late 19th century than the 17th.

249
21:29.134 --> 21:35.529
In logistics, quality control and HR, Crowley was a pioneer; the Industrial

250
21:35.553 --> 21:38.677
Revolution depended crucially on all three skills.

251
21:38.701 --> 21:44.848
The next group of industrialists all got their start in their 1760s.

252
21:44.872 --> 21:50.739
Overall, with an acceleration of patent applications and economic growth, and new

253
21:50.763 --> 21:56.129
canal and country bank networks, the Industrial Revolution took off in the late

254
21:56.153 --> 22:00.394
1760s, and these industrialists were its pioneers.

255
22:00.418 --> 22:07.447
Modern marketing was invented by Josiah Wedgwood, who opened his first pottery in

256
22:07.471 --> 22:14.287
1759 and achieved a business breakthrough by a sale to Queen Charlotte in 1764.

257
22:14.311 --> 22:19.245
His potteries mostly employed traditional production methods, yet through

258
22:19.269 --> 22:24.921
sophisticated design, marketing and distribution they achieved a global market

259
22:24.945 --> 22:27.864
and consumer salience previously impossible.

260
22:27.888 --> 22:34.163
Wedgwood’s innovative design and marketing showed the way to the mass consumer

261
22:34.187 --> 22:37.662
society of the next centuries; they were as important to

262
22:37.686 --> 22:40.488
modernity as James Watt’s condenser.

263
22:40.512 --> 22:47.340
John Wilkinson, known as “iron-mad” built a collection of iron works larger than

264
22:47.364 --> 22:53.161
Crowley’s, using the new canal network for distribution and pioneering the use of

265
22:53.185 --> 22:54.884
iron in many new areas.

266
22:54.908 --> 23:00.492
However, his greatest contribution was his cylinder boring machine, clamping the

267
23:00.516 --> 23:06.643
solid cylinder stock to the bench and then, using water-power, rotating a very

268
23:06.667 --> 23:09.377
hard iron boring tool against it.

269
23:09.401 --> 23:16.884
This was initially used for cannon but from 1776 used for the cylinders of Watt’s

270
23:16.908 --> 23:22.335
steam engines, achieving a tenfold improvement in the fit between piston and

271
23:22.359 --> 23:27.795
cylinder “to the width of a shilling.” Later Wilkinson went into the copper

272
23:27.819 --> 23:33.665
business, buying Cornish copper mines, fitting Watt engines for pumping and using

273
23:33.689 --> 23:37.160
the resulting product to produce a “token” copper coinage.

274
23:37.184 --> 23:43.279
Matthew Boulton’s principal importance is as the sponsor of James Watt’s steam

275
23:43.303 --> 23:49.185
engine; Boulton and Watt became its principal manufacturer after 1783 and thus

276
23:49.209 --> 23:52.708
became one of the most important early industrial companies.

277
23:52.732 --> 24:00.655
Before that, Boulton set up the Soho Manufactory in 1765 and pursued a career

278
24:00.679 --> 24:07.054
of widespread industrial experimentation, competing with Wedgwood in silverware and

279
24:07.078 --> 24:12.033
ormolu ware, being a founder of the intellectually important Birmingham Lunar

280
24:12.057 --> 24:18.262
Society, sponsoring the Birmingham Canal and later manufacturing the “cartwheel”

281
24:18.286 --> 24:24.846
copper pennies and twopence pieces of 1797 under the direction of Charles Jenkinson,

282
24:24.870 --> 24:26.763
first Earl of Liverpool.

283
24:26.787 --> 24:32.704
His hit-and-miss approach to enterprise meant he never became particularly rich,

284
24:32.728 --> 24:35.936
but his contributions were highly significant.

285
24:35.960 --> 24:42.860
Undoubtedly the best businessman of the Industrial Revolution’s pioneers was Sir

286
24:42.884 --> 24:46.551
Richard Arkwright – the only one who got a knighthood.

287
24:46.575 --> 24:52.406
He ended up richer than Wedgwood, having started with fewer advantages – he was

288
24:52.430 --> 24:57.593
completely unschooled, then became a barber and invented a waterproof periwig

289
24:57.617 --> 25:01.567
dye, from the proceeds of which he funded his textile empire.

290
25:01.591 --> 25:07.840
He hired a clockmaker John Kay to design a rotary spinning machine, the “spinning

291
25:07.864 --> 25:13.377
frame” initially telling Kay he was producing a perpetual motion machine.

292
25:13.401 --> 25:20.539
With his spinning frame he set up a mill at Cromford in 1771 with two partners,

293
25:20.563 --> 25:25.039
then expanded into further mills, all powered by water wheels.

294
25:25.063 --> 25:32.178
Making patterned cotton fabrics was illegal, by a truly foolish piece of Whig

295
25:32.202 --> 25:38.766
1720 legislation so, possibly with the help of 2nd Earl Gower, of whom more

296
25:38.790 --> 25:41.997
below, he got the law changed in 1774.

297
25:42.021 --> 25:47.605
From there on, his ascent was swift, employing over 5,000 people in the early

298
25:47.629 --> 25:53.112
1780s, mostly children, who were cheaper, and surviving the destruction of his

299
25:53.136 --> 25:58.694
Birkacre factory by a Luddite arson attack in 1779.

300
25:58.718 --> 26:05.734
Arkwright retired in the early 1780s and his son also Richard took over the

301
26:05.758 --> 26:11.649
business. He maintained a position in textiles, expanding by lending to other

302
26:11.673 --> 26:17.255
manufacturers and foreclosing when borrowers got in difficulty; he did the

303
26:17.279 --> 26:22.715
same on the aristocracy’s landholdings as well as building the successful Cromford

304
26:22.739 --> 26:27.248
Canal. By his death in 1843 he was the richest commoner in

305
26:27.272 --> 26:29.709
Britain, worth £3.5 million.

306
26:29.733 --> 26:34.768
Finally, there were two important figures who broadened the Industrial Revolution

307
26:34.792 --> 26:37.090
and introduced it to new fields.

308
26:37.114 --> 26:42.356
The more important of these was Henry Maudslay, who got his start as apprentice

309
26:42.380 --> 26:46.237
to another important London-based engineer, Joseph Bramah.

310
26:46.261 --> 26:53.806
Bramah was a prolific inventor, designing a modified water closet (which remained a

311
26:53.830 --> 26:58.980
profitable business through the early 19th century) a patented lock, which was not

312
26:59.174 --> 27:02.930
“cracked” until 1851 and the hydraulic press.

313
27:02.954 --> 27:08.874
He also realized the need for much tighter engineering tolerances but was less adept

314
27:08.898 --> 27:14.094
at production – his locks could not be manufactured profitably until Maudslay

315
27:14.118 --> 27:16.595
joined him in 1790.

316
27:16.619 --> 27:23.457
Maudslay began by organizing Bramah’s manufacturing operation, then in 1797 set

317
27:23.481 --> 27:24.895
up his own business.

318
27:24.919 --> 27:32.996
There he invented the screw cutting lathe, the bench micrometer, a steam dredger, a

319
27:33.020 --> 27:36.778
table-top steam engine and established the machine tool industry.

320
27:36.802 --> 27:42.475
He was also the principal designer of the Portsmouth Naval Block Works, the world’s

321
27:42.499 --> 27:49.096
first example of mass production, able to produce 130,000 pulley blocks a year using

322
27:49.120 --> 27:54.162
interchangeable parts, a key Maudslay innovation that was not general until the

323
27:54.186 --> 28:00.596
1850s. Both Bramah and Maudslay had important pupils; Bramah’s most important

324
28:00.620 --> 28:06.917
was Joseph Woolf, a pioneer in compound engines, while Maudslay’s included David

325
28:06.941 --> 28:13.168
Napier, Joseph Whitworth, Joseph Clement, James Nasmyth and Richard Roberts,

326
28:13.192 --> 28:18.582
inventor in 1822 of the most effective power loom for the textile industry.

327
28:18.606 --> 28:23.398
Between them, Bramah and Maudslay hugely improved the tolerances used in

328
28:23.422 --> 28:27.242
manufacturing – without their improvements railway engines would have been

329
28:27.266 --> 28:32.193
impossible – and invented most of the machine tools that would build 19th

330
28:32.217 --> 28:37.342
century engineering. Neither became wealthy, but both built engineering

331
28:37.366 --> 28:39.856
businesses lasting more than a century.

332
28:39.880 --> 28:45.604
The other industrial innovator, creating an entirely new sector, was Charles

333
28:45.628 --> 28:51.644
Tennant, who in 1798 gained a patent for a new method of bleaching textiles,

334
28:51.668 --> 28:56.405
previously done by soaking them in urine and leaving them for 18 months.

335
28:56.429 --> 29:01.006
With his new “bleaching powder” Tennant set up a factory at St.

336
29:01.030 --> 29:07.425
Rollox near Glasgow and thereafter diversified, so that by 1830 St.

337
29:07.449 --> 29:13.006
Rollox was the world’s largest chemical factory, spread over 100 acres with

338
29:13.030 --> 29:19.890
250,000 square feet of floor space, only 1,000 employees, and from the following

339
29:19.914 --> 29:22.995
year its own private railway link.

340
29:23.019 --> 29:27.086
The chemical industry is generally regarded as a mainstay of the “second

341
29:27.110 --> 29:31.514
industrial revolution” from the 1870s; Tennant’s success at St.

342
29:31.538 --> 29:36.042
Rollox shows the industry was already very substantial and profitable half a century

343
29:36.066 --> 29:42.460
earlier. With Michael Faraday inventing the electric motor in 1821 and the dynamo

344
29:42.484 --> 29:47.894
in 1831 and Goldsworthy Gurney’s road carriages competitive in performance with

345
29:47.918 --> 29:49.989
railways, the seeds of the

346
29:50.013 --> 29:52.109
“second industrial revolution”

347
29:52.133 --> 29:55.443
were all sown before 1830.

348
29:55.467 --> 29:59.416
The Industrial Revolution also involved infrastructure.

349
29:59.440 --> 30:04.304
There was a continuous program of upgrading Britain’s winding, muddy road

350
30:04.328 --> 30:09.715
network, with the principal figures being Thomas Telford and John McAdam, who

351
30:09.739 --> 30:15.438
invented “macadamization” a road building process involving crushed stones bound

352
30:15.462 --> 30:20.708
with gravel on a firm base of larger stones and given a camber to ensure proper

353
30:20.732 --> 30:26.026
drainage. Earlier, the rivers had been made navigable, improving shipping

354
30:26.050 --> 30:30.791
possibilities, while there were two attempts to drain the Fens, one in the

355
30:30.815 --> 30:38.242
1630s and the second successful one in the 1820s involving steam pumping technology.

356
30:38.266 --> 30:43.607
However, by far the most important infrastructure upgrade was the canal

357
30:43.631 --> 30:50.313
system, mostly built in three decades after 1760 and designed by James Brindley.

358
30:50.337 --> 30:57.047
James Brindley got involved in canals through the Staffordshire landowner

359
30:57.071 --> 31:00.902
Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Gower.

360
31:00.926 --> 31:06.911
Gower around 1757 hired Brindley to carry out a survey of the

361
31:06.935 --> 31:08.973
future Trent and Mersey Canal.

362
31:08.997 --> 31:16.277
This 93-mile canal proved too expensive for Gower’s pocket alone, but Gower had

363
31:16.301 --> 31:21.309
married the Duke of Bridgewater’s sister and so introduced Brindley to Bridgewater,

364
31:21.333 --> 31:27.391
coal from whose mines at Worsley needed a much shorter canal to reach a market in

365
31:27.415 --> 31:33.333
Manchester. The Bridgewater Canal was authorized in 1759, the first stage

366
31:33.357 --> 31:38.026
completed in 1761 and the final canal to Liverpool completed in

367
31:38.050 --> 31:41.860
1765, all paid for by Bridgewater.

368
31:41.884 --> 31:44.840
This was the first major canal completed.

369
31:44.864 --> 31:50.125
It demonstrated the economic effect a canal could have, halving the price of

370
31:50.149 --> 31:55.251
coal in Manchester, and deriving a large profit for Bridgewater’s coal mines.

371
31:55.275 --> 32:00.611
The benefits of canals for transporting heavy goods were simple.

372
32:00.635 --> 32:08.687
The maximum load for a horse-drawn cart was about 2 tons, and that required two

373
32:08.711 --> 32:13.882
men to lever the cart out of innumerable potholes or rescue it when it ran off the

374
32:13.906 --> 32:20.711
road. However, a canal narrowboat could carry 50 tons of goods, and required the

375
32:20.735 --> 32:25.047
same horse and the same two men, one to guide the barge and the other to tend the

376
32:25.071 --> 32:30.432
horse. Canals were therefore potentially about 25 times as productive as road

377
32:30.456 --> 32:33.236
transport for heavy goods such as coal.

378
32:33.260 --> 32:38.920
After the Bridgewater Canal, the first large canals to get Parliamentary approval

379
32:38.944 --> 32:44.518
were the Staffordshire and Worcestershire and the Trent and Mersey, both approved in

380
32:44.542 --> 32:50.026
May 1766 by the same Act of Parliament, sponsored by Gower.

381
32:50.050 --> 32:55.320
Brindley was heavily involved in the engineering of both canals; they were part

382
32:55.344 --> 33:01.670
of his “Grand Cross” scheme to link the Trent, Mersey, Severn and Thames rivers.

383
33:01.694 --> 33:07.300
He was also involved in the design of the Birmingham Canal, the Coventry Canal, the

384
33:07.324 --> 33:12.050
Oxford Canal (all part of his “Grand Cross” scheme) and the Leeds and Liverpool

385
33:12.074 --> 33:16.783
Canal, though he died in 1772 before most of those canals were finished.

386
33:16.807 --> 33:22.867
Brindley knew that, compared to the Bridgewater Canal, sponsored by a Duke,

387
33:22.891 --> 33:27.993
his Grand Cross canals were much longer and would be financed mostly by local

388
33:28.017 --> 33:29.930
tradesmen of limited means.

389
33:29.954 --> 33:34.072
Hence, they should lack the Bridgewater Canal’s luxury features.

390
33:34.096 --> 33:39.132
The canal routes were designed to follow the contours of the land, producing

391
33:39.156 --> 33:44.087
longer, winding canals but with fewer viaducts and tunnels, both very expensive.

392
33:44.111 --> 33:50.532
He also designed them with only a 7-feet width, rather than the Bridgewater’s 15

393
33:50.556 --> 33:54.420
feet, making them single-track thoroughfares for “narrowboat” canal

394
33:54.444 --> 33:57.910
boats, 7 feet wide and up to 70 feet long.

395
33:57.934 --> 34:03.801
Brindley’s Grand Cross canals created for the first time a national transportation

396
34:03.825 --> 34:09.500
network, so heavy raw materials could reach the new factories while heavy goods

397
34:09.524 --> 34:14.819
from the industrial Midlands could be transported cheaply both nationally and,

398
34:14.843 --> 34:17.428
through the ports, internationally.

399
34:17.452 --> 34:23.799
Brindley never became rich, receiving a few hundred pounds per annum from each

400
34:23.823 --> 34:25.597
canal he advised.

401
34:25.621 --> 34:30.853
Moreover, his last years, dashing around the Midlands on horseback from canal to

402
34:30.877 --> 34:34.577
canal, may have been stressful enough to shorten his life.

403
34:34.601 --> 34:38.525
Nevertheless, he has an excellent claim to rank as the Father of

404
34:38.549 --> 34:41.280
the Industrial Revolution.

405
34:41.304 --> 34:45.255
Infrastructure also used new technologies.

406
34:45.279 --> 34:49.061
One that caught on remarkably quickly was gas lighting.

407
34:49.085 --> 34:54.214
William Murdoch, of Boulton and Watt, was the first person to light his house by

408
34:54.238 --> 34:56.919
coal gas, in 1792.

409
34:56.943 --> 35:04.055
Further experimentation by Friedrich Accum, Friedrich Winsor and Samuel Clegg

410
35:04.079 --> 35:09.669
led to Pall Mall being gas-lit as a demonstration project in 1807.

411
35:09.693 --> 35:16.153
The Gas, Light and Coke Company was formed with a £1 million share issue to light

412
35:16.177 --> 35:21.674
central London in 1812 and the great majority of provincial towns had gas

413
35:21.698 --> 35:27.480
street lighting, gas light in factories and some domestic gas lighting by 1825.

414
35:27.504 --> 35:33.207
Street lighting and domestic lighting were important, but gas lighting’s greatest

415
35:33.231 --> 35:38.571
economic effect was in factories, which could now run 24 hours if sales were good.

416
35:38.595 --> 35:45.659
Finally, we come to the statesmen whose work facilitated industrialization.

417
35:45.683 --> 35:51.163
Four statesmen who were in office as the Industrial Revolution took off and whose

418
35:51.187 --> 35:56.840
work directly facilitated it were Gower, William Pitt the younger and the two

419
35:56.864 --> 36:01.173
Jenkinsons, father and son, the first and second Earls of Liverpool.

420
36:01.197 --> 36:07.497
Gower, first, was so important a figure in Britain’s economic development it is a

421
36:07.521 --> 36:12.168
scathing criticism of the history profession that no full-length biography

422
36:12.192 --> 36:18.276
of him exists. He gave James Brindley his start in canal construction and steered

423
36:18.300 --> 36:20.430
the early canals through Parliament.

424
36:20.454 --> 36:27.738
Also, in 1764 he formed a partnership, Earl Gower and Company to develop the

425
36:27.762 --> 36:33.556
coal, lime and ironstone resources of his estates around Lilleshall, Staffordshire,

426
36:33.662 --> 36:38.326
building the Donnington Wood Canal, which was completed in 1768.

427
36:38.350 --> 36:45.224
Initially Earl Gower and Company acted primarily as landlord, but in 1792 the

428
36:45.248 --> 36:50.178
partnership bought the Donnington ironworks and began operating it directly,

429
36:50.202 --> 36:56.266
being replaced by the Lilleshall Company in 1802, in which Gower’s second son 1st

430
36:56.290 --> 36:58.300
Earl Granville became a partner.

431
36:58.324 --> 37:04.570
And Lilleshall survived until the blasted socialists nationalized it in 1949.

432
37:04.594 --> 37:12.842
Politically, Gower served as Lord Privy Seal in 1755-57, and returned to

433
37:12.866 --> 37:19.354
government in 1767, adding a Tory flavour to the Grafton ministry, and solidifying

434
37:19.378 --> 37:23.019
its expertise in economic and industrial matters.

435
37:23.043 --> 37:29.200
He remained through the North ministry until 1779, being a noted hard-liner on

436
37:29.224 --> 37:33.943
dealing with the Americans, but resigned in disgust at North’s vacillations.

437
37:33.967 --> 37:40.742
He was invited four times to become Prime Minister by George III but

438
37:40.766 --> 37:42.984
turned the King down each time.

439
37:43.008 --> 37:50.039
Then in December 1783, Gower was the most important sponsor of Pitt’s sudden

440
37:50.063 --> 37:55.523
emergence and as Lord President of the Council he was the keystone member of

441
37:55.547 --> 38:01.752
Pitt’s initial Cabinet, being seen by North as forming a coalition with Pitt

442
38:01.776 --> 38:04.340
rather than merely serving in his government.

443
38:04.364 --> 38:10.038
Gower was in office for the first 11 years of Pitt’s ministry, pushing it in a Tory

444
38:10.062 --> 38:14.539
direction, in which he was joined after 1786 by Jenkinson.

445
38:14.563 --> 38:21.414
His influence was further increased by his former land agent Thomas Gilbert serving

446
38:21.438 --> 38:27.329
from 1784 to 1794 as Chairman of the House of Commons’ Ways and Means Committee.

447
38:27.353 --> 38:33.198
At his death, Gower, now Marquess of Stafford, was the fifth richest man in

448
38:33.222 --> 38:36.338
Britain, with a net worth of £2 million.

449
38:36.362 --> 38:41.197
Gower brought his colleagues an understanding of industrialization and the

450
38:41.221 --> 38:44.768
national economy beyond London, which was to prove invaluable

451
38:44.792 --> 38:47.619
to both North and Pitt.

452
38:47.643 --> 38:53.727
Groomed for leadership by his domineering, elderly father, William Pitt the younger

453
38:53.751 --> 38:58.013
achieved the pinnacle of power extraordinarily young, then performed with

454
38:58.037 --> 39:02.253
remarkable ability. He had read Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations” as a

455
39:02.277 --> 39:07.366
teenager and absorbed its teachings – Smith himself was of course a major

456
39:07.390 --> 39:11.453
inspiration to the industrialists and statesmen who followed him.

457
39:11.477 --> 39:17.080
Even though the national budget was very shaky when Pitt took over, he took Smith’s

458
39:17.104 --> 39:24.338
advice and lowered customs duties on the easily smuggled items of tea, wine,

459
39:24.362 --> 39:26.382
spirits and tobacco.

460
39:26.406 --> 39:32.793
This, together with energetic customs administration, brought in £2 million of

461
39:32.817 --> 39:36.742
additional revenue and stabilized the nation’s finances.

462
39:36.766 --> 39:42.732
Thereafter, the economy boomed, and Pitt was the first to recognize the changes in

463
39:42.756 --> 39:48.556
it in his historic budget speech of 17 February 1792.

464
39:48.580 --> 39:54.732
However, the heroic portrayal by Victorian historians of one who achieved everything

465
39:54.756 --> 40:00.530
as a paragon standing alone is wrong; in his early years of power, Pitt’s fine

466
40:00.554 --> 40:07.138
economic policies owed much to Gower and Jenkinson, both a generation older.

467
40:07.162 --> 40:13.034
Later, apart from the older Dundas, Pitt amassed a solid collection of able

468
40:13.058 --> 40:15.258
colleagues and younger acolytes.

469
40:15.282 --> 40:21.059
He eventually became personally isolated, descending into illness, alcoholism and

470
40:21.083 --> 40:23.834
debt and dying at 46.

471
40:23.858 --> 40:30.731
Charles Jenkinson 1st Earl of Liverpool, father of the prime minister, was cousin

472
40:30.755 --> 40:33.942
to an ancestrally Tory line of Oxfordshire baronets.

473
40:33.966 --> 40:40.768
He entered top politics as Bute’s private secretary in 1761, then became one of two

474
40:40.792 --> 40:44.575
Secretaries to the Treasury under Grenville, where he designed the Stamp

475
40:44.599 --> 40:47.018
Act, before losing office with Grenville.

476
40:47.042 --> 40:53.537
As a Lord of the Treasury in the late 1760s Jenkinson befriended North, then was

477
40:53.561 --> 40:58.326
an increasingly important communications link between the King and North throughout

478
40:58.350 --> 41:03.142
North’s tenure, becoming Secretary at War in 1778.

479
41:03.166 --> 41:09.033
After North fell, Jenkinson played a supporting role in the manoeuvring that

480
41:09.057 --> 41:13.773
brought Pitt to power, then became President of the Board of Trade in 1786,

481
41:13.797 --> 41:20.626
where he remained until 1804, co-operating with Matthew Boulton on a notable coinage

482
41:20.650 --> 41:24.966
scheme (the Cartwheel Twopence piece) and acquiring the barony

483
41:24.990 --> 41:28.284
of Hawkesbury in 1786 and the earldom of

484
41:28.308 --> 41:30.703
Liverpool in 1796.

485
41:30.727 --> 41:35.757
He derived his economic policies from the Oxfordshire School of economic thought;

486
41:35.781 --> 41:40.861
unlike Pitt he was not a whole-hearted believer in Smith’s free-trade theories,

487
41:40.885 --> 41:44.306
believing that customs duties were important elements in

488
41:44.330 --> 41:46.487
financing British governments.

489
41:46.511 --> 41:53.554
Finally, Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool was prime minister during the

490
41:53.578 --> 41:56.523
period the Industrial Revolution came to full flower.

491
41:56.547 --> 42:01.364
I have covered his achievements elsewhere; there were two especially important for

492
42:01.388 --> 42:03.185
the Industrial Revolution.

493
42:03.209 --> 42:08.885
The Corn Law of 1815 protected British agriculture and ensured that the

494
42:08.909 --> 42:15.086
Industrial Revolution would continue based on high wages, lessening manufacturer

495
42:15.110 --> 42:19.302
profits but sharpening the incentives for technological innovation.

496
42:19.326 --> 42:25.840
Second, his 1819 return to the Gold Standard not only set Britain up as the

497
42:25.864 --> 42:31.542
centre of world finance, it cemented its position as the high-wage nexus of

498
42:31.566 --> 42:37.493
industrial innovation, whose productivity enabled it to dominate world markets.

499
42:37.517 --> 42:42.944
His policies were partially reversed over the decades following his death; that

500
42:42.968 --> 42:48.163
reversal caused Britain’s industrial lead to dissipate and other countries to erode

501
42:48.187 --> 42:50.681
her competitive position.

502
42:50.705 --> 42:56.310
In summary, the Industrial Revolution had many fathers, of which a few were

503
42:56.334 --> 42:57.847
especially significant.

504
42:57.871 --> 43:02.924
Thomas Newcomen made the technological leap forward that made it all possible.

505
43:02.948 --> 43:05.269
Josiah Wedgwood was the most

506
43:05.293 --> 43:06.948
important creator of a modern

507
43:06.972 --> 43:09.340
worldwide manufacturer.

508
43:09.364 --> 43:14.708
James Brindley made the crucial infrastructure step that unified Britain’s

509
43:14.732 --> 43:17.388
market and manufacturing capability.

510
43:17.508 --> 43:23.834
Finally, two second Earls, Gower and Liverpool, presided over almost all the

511
43:23.858 --> 43:28.622
Industrial Revolution’s most creative years, designed the policies and

512
43:28.646 --> 43:32.314
accumulated the knowledge needed for Britain’s industrial leadership.

513
43:32.338 --> 43:39.426
There you have it – five fathers, not one, all of whom deserve our utmost gratitude.

514
43:39.450 --> 43:42.441
Thank you very much for listening.

515
43:42.465 --> 43:47.161
That is the end of Tory Stories Podcast No. 4
