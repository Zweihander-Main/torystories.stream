00:04.937 --> 00:11.633
These Tory Stories podcasts aim to act as counters to the universal Whig version of

2
00:11.657 --> 00:17.762
history, observing history and the world from the viewpoint of an 18th Century Tory.

3
00:17.786 --> 00:21.927
Their focus will be on the Industrial Revolution and the

4
00:21.951 --> 00:25.430
Tory achievements of 1660-1832.

5
00:25.454 --> 00:30.908
Tory Story V – Ranking the Greatest Prime Ministers

6
00:30.932 --> 00:37.182
My book “Britain’s Greatest Prime Minister – Lord Liverpool” makes the claim that

7
00:37.206 --> 00:39.856
Liverpool was the greatest of Britain’s Prime Ministers.

8
00:39.880 --> 00:45.749
In an earlier podcast, I promised to discuss that claim, and to place him among

9
00:45.773 --> 00:49.674
Britain’s other great Prime Ministers, producing a ranking at the end.

10
00:49.698 --> 00:55.970
I shall not attempt to discuss all 57 (as of this week) Prime Ministers, only the

11
00:55.994 --> 00:58.547
ones which have a reasonable claim to rank near the top.

12
00:58.571 --> 01:04.343
This has the advantage of not requiring me to make invidious distinctions between

13
01:04.367 --> 01:09.559
recent holders of that office, since I think observers of all political stripes

14
01:09.583 --> 01:14.151
would agree with me that the eight who have occupied the office in the last 33 years

15
01:14.175 --> 01:18.486
have been pretty undistinguished, with Lady Thatcher the last with

16
01:18.510 --> 01:21.335
any claim to greatness.

17
01:21.359 --> 01:26.990
I shall discuss the great and near-great in chronological order; this is both logical

18
01:27.014 --> 01:30.607
and leaves the more contentious entries towards the end.

19
01:30.631 --> 01:36.038
In total, there are 15 contenders for greatness, with some included for their

20
01:36.062 --> 01:39.143
reputation rather than their actual achievements.

21
01:39.167 --> 01:42.862
In deference to “Britain’s Greatest Prime Minister” I shall

22
01:42.886 --> 01:44.958
leave Liverpool until last.

23
01:44.982 --> 01:47.719
Walpole

24
01:47.743 --> 01:52.519
Sir Robert Walpole, first, is always said to have invented the office of prime

25
01:52.543 --> 01:57.663
minister. Actually, I could quibble – other statesmen, such as the Earls of Clarendon,

26
01:57.687 --> 02:03.606
Danby and Rochester, had performed prime ministerial functions from the Restoration.

27
02:03.630 --> 02:09.575
However, Walpole was operating with a weaker monarchy – indeed, one that for his

28
02:09.599 --> 02:14.918
first six years (George I) did not speak English -- and was its longest-serving

29
02:14.942 --> 02:17.102
occupant, with over 20 years in office.

30
02:17.126 --> 02:23.406
Walpole rose to power by dealing deftly with the financial and political blow-back

31
02:23.430 --> 02:28.463
from the South Sea Bubble’s collapse, imposing rough justice on the company’s

32
02:28.487 --> 02:33.943
management, side-lining several of his rivals who had been more closely involved

33
02:34.062 --> 02:39.038
in the South Sea’s scheming and through his friends at the Bank of England providing

34
02:39.062 --> 02:43.222
enough of a bailout that there was no long-term collapse in investor sentiment.

35
02:43.246 --> 02:49.367
Once this was done, then provided he kept Royal favour and kept the country at peace

36
02:49.391 --> 02:52.382
Walpole could stay in power indefinitely.

37
02:52.406 --> 02:57.214
He was an excellent man of business and prized the virtue of moderation,

38
02:57.238 --> 03:03.366
fashionable at that time in contrast to the “enthusiasm” of the previous century.

39
03:03.390 --> 03:08.767
Through his Sinking Fund and twenty years of peace, he stabilized the government

40
03:08.791 --> 03:12.977
debt, reducing annual interest payments by 27%.

41
03:13.001 --> 03:18.934
He established an alliance with France, already a non-traditional foreign policy,

42
03:18.958 --> 03:25.399
that proved surprisingly durable, although when war came in 1739, initially with

43
03:25.423 --> 03:28.399
Spain, he proved an ineffective war minister.

44
03:28.423 --> 03:36.183
On the debit side, with the help of George I and George II, he established Britain as

45
03:36.207 --> 03:42.166
an effective one-party state, with Tories barred from power altogether and dissident

46
03:42.190 --> 03:44.958
Whigs relegated to futile opposition.

47
03:44.982 --> 03:52.126
His social legislation also tended towards the repressive, as did his tax policy, and

48
03:52.150 --> 03:58.534
the 1723 “Black Act” introduced capital punishment for more than 50 working-class

49
03:58.558 --> 04:03.439
crimes. In Scotland and Ireland his corruption and repression were worse than

50
04:03.463 --> 04:07.847
in England, with the “Wood’s Halfpence” swindle a black spot.

51
04:07.871 --> 04:14.015
On the other hand, he used a light touch in regulating the American colonies and his

52
04:14.039 --> 04:18.247
overall Whiggery and tolerance of Dissent were much appreciated there.

53
04:18.271 --> 04:26.166
Overall, nicely self-described as “no saint, no Spartan, no reformer” Walpole

54
04:26.190 --> 04:30.006
left Britain richer and more stable than he found it, but

55
04:30.030 --> 04:32.286
also more corrupt and less open.

56
04:32.310 --> 04:34.807
Pelham

57
04:34.831 --> 04:40.999
Henry Pelham, Walpole’s successor but one, was the brains and financial acumen in his

58
04:41.023 --> 04:46.559
family, while his older brother Thomas, Duke of Newcastle managed the family’s

59
04:46.663 --> 04:49.358
extensive patronage and foreign policy.

60
04:49.382 --> 04:53.439
In many ways Pelham was an improved version of Walpole.

61
04:53.463 --> 04:58.967
He pursued the same policy of peace, economy and low taxes, but he was not

62
04:58.991 --> 05:05.046
personally corrupt. He was a less outgoing personality than Walpole, and not an

63
05:05.070 --> 05:10.847
especially good Parliamentary speaker, but like Walpole was a superb administrator and

64
05:10.871 --> 05:12.558
excellent with finance.

65
05:12.582 --> 05:19.791
Initially, Pelham was subordinate to the autocratic Carteret who once remarked of

66
05:19.815 --> 05:24.455
him: “He was only a chief clerk to Sir Robert Walpole, and why he should expect to

67
05:24.479 --> 05:31.703
be more under me, I can’t imagine; he did his drudgery and he shall do mine.” Pelham

68
05:31.727 --> 05:37.367
achieved full power in 1746, before which he was faced with the Young Pretender’s

69
05:37.391 --> 05:41.734
rebellion, which from Scotland reached Derby before it turned back.

70
05:41.758 --> 05:48.047
Pelham’s solution was to recall the King’s younger son the Duke of Cumberland and the

71
05:48.071 --> 05:49.806
British force from Flanders.

72
05:49.830 --> 05:56.446
Cumberland finally defeated the Pretender at Culloden in April 1746, but then

73
05:56.567 --> 06:01.654
undertook a policy of suppressing the Highland clans, over Pelham’s opposition.

74
06:01.678 --> 06:08.838
Pelham established the Whigs with a huge Commons majority at the 1747 election, a

75
06:08.862 --> 06:13.127
position repeated in that of 1754, just after his death.

76
06:13.151 --> 06:18.742
He also ended the War of the Austrian Succession, reduced public spending

77
06:18.766 --> 06:24.166
sharply, modernised the calendar and reduced the interest on the National Debt,

78
06:24.190 --> 06:30.366
with the help of the financier Sampson Gideon converting it in 1751 into the

79
06:30.390 --> 06:36.286
famous Consols, paying 3½% until 1757, 3% thereafter.

80
06:36.310 --> 06:41.678
Overall, Pelham was a quiet but very good Walpolean prime minister.

81
06:41.702 --> 06:45.581
Chatham

82
06:45.605 --> 06:50.335
William Pitt the Elder, first Earl of Chatham has one claim to prime ministerial

83
06:50.359 --> 06:56.095
greatness: he came up with the strategy that won the Seven Years War, added immense

84
06:56.119 --> 06:59.975
territory to the British Empire and made Britain for the first time the leading

85
06:59.999 --> 07:01.218
international power.

86
07:01.242 --> 07:07.339
No other prime minister, not his son, not Churchill, nor Liverpool can make such a

87
07:07.363 --> 07:13.238
claim. However, he was uninterested in domestic or economic policy, and in his

88
07:13.262 --> 07:19.207
later years dangerously encouraged the worst elements in the American colonies,

89
07:19.231 --> 07:24.319
justifying their disruption with radical and inflammatory rhetoric.

90
07:24.343 --> 07:29.960
His second prime ministerial term was cut short by illness but was very

91
07:29.984 --> 07:34.688
undistinguished; the Duke of Grafton, who took over from him, was a considerable

92
07:34.712 --> 07:41.071
improvement. Overall, he was a flawed genius, who deserves to rank above the many

93
07:41.095 --> 07:43.594
mediocrities but not right at the top.

94
07:43.618 --> 07:46.624
Pitt

95
07:46.648 --> 07:51.783
To nineteenth century observers, William Pitt the younger was the greatest prime

96
07:51.807 --> 07:56.839
minister. His supremacy continued to be acknowledged until the World War II

97
07:56.863 --> 08:01.015
generation. Only more recently have mild doubts arisen.

98
08:01.662 --> 08:07.422
Pitt’s term in office breaks naturally into two halves, with the outbreak of war in

99
08:07.446 --> 08:10.009
1793 separating them.

100
08:10.033 --> 08:14.177
In the first half, he was a reforming prime minister who broke

101
08:14.201 --> 08:16.337
new ground in several important ways.

102
08:16.361 --> 08:22.049
He was the first prime minister to implement fully the ideas of “Economical

103
08:22.073 --> 08:25.889
Reform” propagated by the Whigs of the early 1780s.

104
08:25.913 --> 08:32.577
He eliminated many sinecures and, more important, set standards of public service

105
08:32.697 --> 08:38.076
selection and promotion by merit that were to become important during the difficult

106
08:38.100 --> 08:39.769
war years and thereafter.

107
08:39.793 --> 08:45.449
Pitt was also the first prime minister to implement Adam Smith’s principles of free

108
08:45.473 --> 08:49.025
trade and low, transparent taxation.

109
08:49.049 --> 08:54.289
Lower tariffs combined with a decline in smuggling to produce a substantial increase

110
08:54.313 --> 08:56.073
in public revenue.

111
08:56.097 --> 09:02.249
Contemporaries were also impressed by Pitt’s 1786 establishment of the Sinking

112
09:02.273 --> 09:05.089
Fund on a solider base than that of Walpole.

113
09:05.113 --> 09:10.770
Modern commentators scoff at this, but the Sinking Fund maintained Britain’s credit

114
09:10.794 --> 09:16.819
rating and its ability to raise money during the late 1790s, when national

115
09:16.843 --> 09:19.531
insolvency could easily have occurred.

116
09:19.555 --> 09:25.459
Among Pitt’s most important reforms were those in the public service, including the

117
09:25.483 --> 09:27.707
Army, the Ordnance and the Navy.

118
09:27.731 --> 09:33.443
Bills were paid on time, cash management techniques were implemented, and the Navy

119
09:33.555 --> 09:38.091
was brought up to a higher state of efficiency than ever before, essential

120
09:38.115 --> 09:40.475
during the first decade of war.

121
09:40.499 --> 09:45.588
Pitt is often thought to have been almost alone in the early years of his government,

122
09:45.612 --> 09:49.459
with only aristocratic and idle Whigs for support.

123
09:49.483 --> 09:56.027
However Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Gower was a Tory voice of immense

124
09:56.051 --> 10:03.227
experience until 1794, having been in Cabinets on and off since 1757 and

125
10:03.251 --> 10:08.099
overseeing the development of Britain’s canal network in the 1760s.

126
10:08.123 --> 10:16.307
Then Charles Jenkinson joined in 1786 (reaching the Cabinet in 1791) and

127
10:16.331 --> 10:22.068
gradually the government became both more Tory and more efficient, William Grenville

128
10:22.092 --> 10:28.339
and the Tory Robert Dundas joining the Cabinet after 1790, and Portland, Spencer

129
10:28.363 --> 10:33.691
and Burke joining with conservative Whigs in 1794 as Gower retired.

130
10:33.715 --> 10:38.220
Pitt was not an effective war minister.

131
10:38.244 --> 10:43.308
His financial management was poor, attempting to raise too much of the war

132
10:43.332 --> 10:50.236
needs through borrowing, incurring a deficit of 16% of GDP in 1797 and raising

133
10:50.260 --> 10:55.427
the money through an untested merchant bank Boyd, Benfield that went bankrupt.

134
10:55.451 --> 11:02.059
Even his invention of the Income Tax in 1798 failed to solve the problem; it was

135
11:02.083 --> 11:07.876
only after Addington invented income tax withholding in 1803 that income tax yields

136
11:07.900 --> 11:11.656
rose to their proper level and budget deficits declined.

137
11:11.680 --> 11:18.048
Pitt’s military strategy was also ineffectual, assembling repeated coalitions

138
11:18.072 --> 11:22.976
of Europe’s major powers, thereby attempting to win the war in one campaign.

139
11:23.000 --> 11:28.640
With France possessing better generals and generally better military organization,

140
11:28.760 --> 11:33.287
campaigns against it confined to a single year universally brought defeat.

141
11:33.311 --> 11:38.968
Pitt’s second ministry was notably fractious and unsuccessful.

142
11:38.992 --> 11:46.443
Indeed, since he lost the support of Sidmouth/Addington in July 1805, he would

143
11:46.467 --> 11:50.847
almost certainly have suffered defeat had he survived to meet the House of Commons

144
11:50.871 --> 11:52.872
for the 1806 session.

145
11:52.896 --> 11:57.551
His fine reputation therefore rests on the first half of his first ministry.

146
11:57.575 --> 12:02.207
I believe he was better than Lloyd George or Gladstone, but not as good a war

147
12:02.231 --> 12:07.336
minister as Churchill nor as good a minister overall as Liverpool.

148
12:07.360 --> 12:09.087
Peel

149
12:09.111 --> 12:16.456
Sir Robert Peel was the son of a very rich textile entrepreneur and Tory MP, an

150
12:16.480 --> 12:20.983
extremely intelligent man who was told so too often in his early years.

151
12:21.007 --> 12:27.539
He was a successful Home Secretary, but his man-management skills were non-existent,

152
12:27.563 --> 12:33.144
as first became apparent with his failure to hold together the large Commons majority

153
12:33.263 --> 12:35.819
that Liverpool had left his successors.

154
12:35.843 --> 12:44.367
Peel’s first period as prime minister in 1834-35 produced the “Tamworth manifesto,”

155
12:44.391 --> 12:47.727
abandoning the beliefs of much of his party’s base.

156
12:47.751 --> 12:54.615
His second government of 1841-46 also showed a disdain for mainstream Tories and

157
12:54.639 --> 12:58.721
a liking for “reformers” who were later to join the Liberals.

158
12:58.745 --> 13:07.169
Peel’s 1842 restoration of the Income Tax gave the state a solid fiscal basis, which

159
13:07.193 --> 13:11.881
he used for ever more aggressive moves towards mostly unilateral free trade.

160
13:11.905 --> 13:19.161
Peel’s free trade moves culminated in the 1846 Repeal of the Corn Laws, which split

161
13:19.185 --> 13:21.728
his party and ended his government.

162
13:22.070 --> 13:26.920
In the very long term, Repeal and unilateral free trade doomed British

163
13:27.128 --> 13:33.175
agriculture once American competition became effective in the 1870s and ended

164
13:33.199 --> 13:37.167
British industrial supremacy as competitors built up their

165
13:37.191 --> 13:39.711
industries behind high tariff walls.

166
13:39.735 --> 13:45.035
Peel and his Whig successors grossly mishandled the Irish potato famine,

167
13:45.166 --> 13:50.087
pursuing the irrelevant remedy of Corn Law abolition while failing to implement

168
13:50.111 --> 13:54.039
short-term relief measures that had been second nature in the

169
13:54.063 --> 13:55.954
British famines of the 1790s.

170
13:55.978 --> 13:59.582
As a prime minister, Peel was at best average.

171
13:59.606 --> 14:01.883
Palmerston

172
14:01.907 --> 14:06.594
Palmerston had gained a good grasp of economics at Edinburgh University.

173
14:06.618 --> 14:11.874
He was an admirable Secretary at War for 19 years from 1809.

174
14:11.898 --> 14:18.130
Regrettably he resigned from Wellington’s Cabinet with the other Canningites in 1828,

175
14:18.232 --> 14:23.679
then negotiated successfully with the Whigs, who lacked Ministerial experience,

176
14:23.703 --> 14:26.050
becoming Foreign Secretary in

177
14:26.074 --> 14:28.544
1830, remaining so in Whig

178
14:28.568 --> 14:30.823
administrations for 22 years.

179
14:30.847 --> 14:37.076
Palmerston’s foreign policy was an extension of Canning’s: opposed to the

180
14:37.100 --> 14:42.598
continental “autocracies,” generally supportive of revolutions, whether or not

181
14:42.622 --> 14:47.739
they had genuine popular backing, and bombastic and prickly when it came to

182
14:47.871 --> 14:53.056
British interests. Overall, he was a less successful upholder of British power and

183
14:53.080 --> 14:57.995
prestige than would be Salisbury, in more difficult circumstances forty years later.

184
14:58.126 --> 15:04.679
After two years as Home Secretary, Palmerston succeeded to the Premiership

185
15:04.703 --> 15:08.235
with a mandate to win the Crimean War, for which he had agitated.

186
15:08.259 --> 15:13.911
This he did successfully, beginning a decade in power in which he was the

187
15:13.935 --> 15:18.643
country’s most popular statesman, while blocking further attempts at parliamentary

188
15:18.667 --> 15:21.510
reform or indeed reform in general.

189
15:21.534 --> 15:27.651
While Palmerston’s foreign policy followed Canning, his domestic and economic policies

190
15:27.675 --> 15:33.346
followed Liverpool; consequently, his Whig followers, notably Gladstone, were

191
15:33.370 --> 15:36.204
discontented but the country thoroughly approved.

192
15:36.228 --> 15:42.050
Palmerston was a much-loved prime minister in easy times but, being in the wrong

193
15:42.074 --> 15:45.607
party, did little to solve Britain’s structural problems.

194
15:45.631 --> 15:48.923
Disraeli

195
15:48.947 --> 15:54.292
Disraeli was a brilliant parliamentary orator, whose invective did much to remove

196
15:54.316 --> 15:59.288
Peel over the Corn Laws, but as prime minister he can be summed up as an

197
15:59.312 --> 16:02.767
Arch-Mediocrity, the epithet he had applied to Liverpool.

198
16:02.879 --> 16:09.451
His first short term in 1868 achieved nothing other than a massive and unexpected

199
16:09.475 --> 16:15.302
election loss based on the new franchise he had defied party principle to institute.

200
16:15.423 --> 16:21.530
Disraeli’s second term included the purchase of the Suez Canal, a useful move

201
16:21.554 --> 16:27.387
that secured British communications for the next 80 years, and a flashy foreign policy

202
16:27.411 --> 16:32.119
“triumph” at the Congress of Berlin that gained Cyprus but not much else.

203
16:32.143 --> 16:37.531
His colonial policy led to British over-extension, with defeats in Afghanistan

204
16:37.555 --> 16:41.027
and South Africa in 1879-80.

205
16:41.051 --> 16:47.066
Domestically, the Disraeli government’s achievements included one disaster, the

206
16:47.090 --> 16:53.015
Trades Disputes Act of 1875, which by giving trades unions legal immunity

207
16:53.039 --> 16:56.332
poisoned British industrial relations for the next century.

208
16:56.464 --> 17:03.766
Economically, Disraeli’s second term was blighted by the post-1873 downturn, which

209
17:03.790 --> 17:05.995
he failed to alleviate or understand.

210
17:06.019 --> 17:13.251
By the end of his second term, following the protectionist German tariff of 1879, it

211
17:13.275 --> 17:18.196
should have been obvious that unilateral free trade was now devastating British

212
17:18.220 --> 17:22.567
agriculture and doing long-term damage to its industrial position, but Disraeli

213
17:22.678 --> 17:27.468
failed to return to the protectionism he had espoused before 1852.

214
17:27.492 --> 17:32.842
Disraeli was a below-average prime minister, albeit a rather better novelist.

215
17:32.944 --> 17:35.270
Gladstone

216
17:35.294 --> 17:40.027
Gladstone was the son of a major slave-owner, who bought more slave

217
17:40.158 --> 17:46.782
properties at discounts when compensation for slave-owners was proposed in 1824 and

218
17:46.806 --> 17:56.175
received £106,769 compensation from the Slave Compensation Commission, the largest

219
17:56.199 --> 17:58.631
sum paid out by the Commission.

220
17:58.784 --> 18:03.846
Gladstone served as prime minister for more than 12 years, over a period of nearly 26

221
18:03.870 --> 18:07.900
years, reinventing himself several times, moving from

222
18:07.924 --> 18:10.423
right-wing Tory to radical Liberal.

223
18:10.447 --> 18:16.999
As Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gladstone was much admired, but his reputation is

224
18:17.023 --> 18:22.542
overblown. By the time he took over, the economy was expanding rapidly and the debt

225
18:22.566 --> 18:26.251
to GDP ratio was far below its level earlier in the century.

226
18:26.275 --> 18:31.834
Gladstone was a firm believer in free trade; his sponsorship of the

227
18:31.858 --> 18:36.830
Cobden-Chevalier Treaty of 1860 marked that doctrine’s apogee; the U.S.

228
18:36.854 --> 18:42.566
Morrill Tariff of 1862 made Britain’s free-trade strictly unilateral.

229
18:42.590 --> 18:51.595
Gladstone’s first ministry of 1868-74 was his best, passing major reforms such as the

230
18:51.619 --> 18:57.675
1870 Education Act, the abolition of Army commission purchase and the Ballot Act

231
18:57.699 --> 18:59.276
establishing a secret ballot.

232
18:59.300 --> 19:04.900
He also interested himself in Ireland, disestablishing the Church of Ireland and

233
19:04.924 --> 19:06.622
passing a moderate Land Act.

234
19:06.646 --> 19:12.682
In foreign policy, he was pacific, which left Britain as a powerless spectator

235
19:12.706 --> 19:15.540
during the Franco-Prussian war.

236
19:15.564 --> 19:21.042
In 1880 Gladstone conducted the first popular election campaign and won a

237
19:21.066 --> 19:27.335
substantial majority. He passed a radical Irish Land Act, which damaged property

238
19:27.359 --> 19:32.523
rights without pacifying the Irish, as well as a third Reform Act, which improved on

239
19:32.547 --> 19:37.256
the first two by including negotiations with the opposition and compromises on

240
19:37.280 --> 19:38.991
contentious issues.

241
19:39.104 --> 19:45.083
In foreign policy, he became increasingly moralist, and suffered a major PR defeat in

242
19:45.184 --> 19:49.486
1885 with the loss of General Charles Gordon in the Sudan.

243
19:49.510 --> 19:56.367
Gladstone then turned to Irish Home Rule, to attract the support from Irish MPs that

244
19:56.391 --> 19:58.151
would bring him back to power.

245
19:58.175 --> 20:03.450
This was a sensible measure, that would have been much better proposed in 1868 or

246
20:03.474 --> 20:05.943
1880, with a fresh electoral mandate.

247
20:05.967 --> 20:11.070
As it was, by introducing the measure for reasons of parliamentary expediency,

248
20:11.094 --> 20:16.583
failing to consider properly the position of Ulster, and then re-introducing the

249
20:16.607 --> 20:18.863
measure without a majority

250
20:18.887 --> 20:20.971
in 1893, Gladstone made the

251
20:20.995 --> 20:23.210
question politically toxic.

252
20:23.234 --> 20:28.195
Gladstone’s highly successful first ministry and moderately successful second

253
20:28.219 --> 20:32.938
ministry must be balanced against foreign policy failures and what eventually became

254
20:32.962 --> 20:34.934
disaster in Ireland.

255
20:34.958 --> 20:40.143
With a discount for governing in mostly quiescent times, he should rank modestly

256
20:40.167 --> 20:44.230
above average, above Disraeli but below Palmerston and Salisbury.

257
20:44.332 --> 20:47.763
Salisbury

258
20:47.787 --> 20:54.107
Salisbury was prime minister for 13 years and 8 months, the post-Liverpool longevity

259
20:54.131 --> 20:57.775
record. For most of that time, he also held the Foreign Secretaryship.

260
20:57.799 --> 21:04.102
Uniquely among prime ministers, Salisbury had set out a clearly defined political

261
21:04.224 --> 21:06.591
philosophy in the 1860s,

262
21:06.615 --> 21:08.871
which included studies of the

263
21:08.895 --> 21:10.736
younger Pitt and Castlereagh.

264
21:10.760 --> 21:16.380
He then took the India Office in Derby’s last administration of 1866 but resigned in

265
21:16.404 --> 21:18.710
protest at the Second Reform Bill.

266
21:18.734 --> 21:24.983
Salisbury returned to the India Office in 1874, transitioning to the Foreign Office

267
21:25.007 --> 21:31.711
in 1878. When Disraeli died in 1881, he and Northcote succeeded him jointly in the

268
21:31.735 --> 21:36.322
Conservative leadership, but it soon became obvious that Salisbury was the dominant

269
21:36.346 --> 21:42.102
partner. His masterly negotiation of the Third Reform Act secured his position as

270
21:42.224 --> 21:45.675
prime minister when Gladstone resigned in 1885.

271
21:45.699 --> 21:50.580
Salisbury was a truly superior foreign policy prime minister.

272
21:50.604 --> 21:56.254
He expanded the Empire, acquiring territories of 6 million square miles

273
21:56.278 --> 21:58.555
containing 100 million people.

274
21:58.579 --> 22:04.827
In Europe, he rejected close entangling alliances, attempting to work in a balanced

275
22:04.851 --> 22:08.698
manner with the major European autocracies as Castlereagh had.

276
22:08.722 --> 22:11.211
Only the Boer War spotted his record.

277
22:11.235 --> 22:17.011
Domestically, Salisbury was modestly successful.

278
22:17.183 --> 22:23.290
He carried out a reorganization of local government, but his domestic reforms were

279
22:23.314 --> 22:28.195
often in tension with his fundamental beliefs, as in his creation of the leftist

280
22:28.219 --> 22:30.839
London County Council in 1888.

281
22:30.863 --> 22:36.038
In Ireland, he followed a policy of “killing Home Rule by kindness” which did

282
22:36.062 --> 22:39.047
not achieve its central objective.

283
22:39.071 --> 22:43.091
Salisbury’s major missed opportunity was in economics.

284
22:43.115 --> 22:48.890
Salisbury had no intellectual commitment to unilateral free trade, so an Imperial

285
22:49.002 --> 22:55.210
Preference scheme could have emerged in 1895 or even in 1887, when Salisbury

286
22:55.234 --> 22:58.092
enjoyed a safe majority and could have pushed it through.

287
22:58.224 --> 23:03.783
Overall, Salisbury was the best of Queen Victoria’s prime ministers, in an

288
23:03.807 --> 23:06.711
environment that was becoming more difficult.

289
23:06.735 --> 23:10.106
Asquith

290
23:10.130 --> 23:16.074
Asquith was Britain’s first prime minister with working-class origins, achieving

291
23:16.098 --> 23:18.922
academic distinction at Oxford.

292
23:18.946 --> 23:23.698
Home Secretary under Gladstone and Rosebery, he then married the intelligent,

293
23:23.810 --> 23:29.106
witty, fashionable and expensive Margot Tennant, the first politically active prime

294
23:29.130 --> 23:31.167
ministerial spouse.

295
23:31.278 --> 23:39.070
After two years as Chancellor of Exchequer, Asquith occupied the premiership for 8½

296
23:39.094 --> 23:41.391
years, during which the

297
23:41.544 --> 23:43.211
office’s requirements took

298
23:43.235 --> 23:44.850
on their modern heavy level.

299
23:44.958 --> 23:49.150
However, Asquith’s response to them didn’t.

300
23:49.174 --> 23:56.247
He carried on an active social life, much recreational reading, excessive alcohol

301
23:56.359 --> 24:02.151
consumption and an intense but probably Platonic love affair with Venetia Stanley,

302
24:02.175 --> 24:07.035
to whom his letters involved outrageous breaches of the new Official Secrets Act.

303
24:07.059 --> 24:13.318
When not too drunk, he was an excellent Parliamentary speaker, a good administrator

304
24:13.342 --> 24:17.847
and a very quick study, mastering legislative detail with ease.

305
24:17.871 --> 24:24.130
With help from Lloyd George and Churchill Asquith was the true founder of the modern

306
24:24.154 --> 24:31.031
Welfare State, introducing Old Age Pensions in 1908 and a National Insurance scheme in

307
24:31.055 --> 24:37.790
1911. What’s more, given Britain’s remarkable fiscal strength at this time, he

308
24:37.814 --> 24:42.735
managed to do this and build up the world’s most powerful fleet of Dreadnought

309
24:42.759 --> 24:48.906
battleships without running budget deficits or raising taxes beyond a modest top

310
24:48.930 --> 24:55.290
combined rate of 13% income tax and “super tax” in 1914.

311
24:55.314 --> 24:59.566
There are two blots on Asquith’s peacetime record.

312
24:59.590 --> 25:07.663
First, he allowed Lloyd George to inflame the 1909-11 Budget/Constitutional crisis by

313
25:07.687 --> 25:12.811
excessive class war rhetoric, which poisoned relations between the parties,

314
25:12.835 --> 25:20.222
making the 1912-14 Irish Home Rule impasse impossible to settle on compromise terms.

315
25:20.343 --> 25:25.714
Second, he not only deepened the French and Russian alliances, but (highly

316
25:25.836 --> 25:30.960
unconstitutionally) held military conversations with the French without

317
25:30.984 --> 25:36.026
informing his Cabinet, making British participation in any war almost inevitable.

318
25:36.050 --> 25:41.822
Once war came, Asquith’s leadership was only intermittently effective.

319
25:41.846 --> 25:46.386
With all his qualities, his departure in December 1916 was overdue.

320
25:46.558 --> 25:52.310
Despite his fatherhood of the welfare state, Asquith does not deserve to rank

321
25:52.334 --> 25:53.587
much above average.

322
25:53.611 --> 25:56.070
Nevertheless, one cannot help liking him.

323
25:56.094 --> 25:59.762
Lloyd George

324
25:59.863 --> 26:05.558
Lloyd George also came from a poor background, but unlike Asquith he traded on

325
26:05.582 --> 26:07.166
it throughout his life.

326
26:07.190 --> 26:13.894
A fiery Radical Welsh MP and a Boer War pacifist, he was a capable President of the

327
26:13.918 --> 26:16.843
Board of Trade before becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer.

328
26:16.867 --> 26:23.906
His 1911 National Insurance “ninepence for fourpence” scheme was well designed and

329
26:23.930 --> 26:26.439
became the foundation of the modern Welfare State.

330
26:26.463 --> 26:33.674
Throughout his career, Lloyd George had a phobia about the landed rich – not the rich

331
26:33.698 --> 26:38.299
in general, just those with inherited land, whom he consistently demonized.

332
26:38.414 --> 26:45.730
His 1909 Budget included a Land Tax with modest yield but major political

333
26:45.838 --> 26:48.135
aggravation capability, which

334
26:48.159 --> 26:50.790
he exacerbated by irresponsible

335
26:50.814 --> 26:52.867
class-warfare rhetoric.

336
26:52.891 --> 26:58.451
This was followed by a 1912 Land Campaign that fortunately came to nothing, another

337
26:58.475 --> 27:04.531
tax-increasing Budget in 1914, the land tax portions of which became a dead letter

338
27:04.555 --> 27:09.283
when war broke out, and a further Land Campaign after he had lost office.

339
27:09.307 --> 27:16.620
The economic reality was that rural landowners had suffered cruelly since 1873

340
27:16.644 --> 27:21.787
because of unilateral free trade, and by 1910 many of them

341
27:21.811 --> 27:23.511
were approaching bankruptcy.

342
27:23.535 --> 27:29.422
In the first year of the war, Lloyd George did not raise taxes sufficiently to finance

343
27:29.543 --> 27:34.495
war expenditure -- the same mistake made by Pitt in 1793-1800.

344
27:34.519 --> 27:40.555
He was energetic and notably successful as Minister of Munitions and Secretary of

345
27:40.579 --> 27:45.135
State for War, bringing in outside businessmen to overcome ossified

346
27:45.159 --> 27:48.003
bureaucracies, albeit with significant corruption.

347
27:48.027 --> 27:54.042
During this period he became a believer in “war socialism.” With Press support, he

348
27:54.066 --> 27:55.390
then ousted Asquith.

349
27:55.414 --> 28:01.727
As Prime Minister Lloyd George continued energetic but solved few of the problems

350
28:01.838 --> 28:03.510
that bedevilled Britain’s war effort.

351
28:03.612 --> 28:09.307
There was little historical memory of the Napoleonic Wars so that it took until April

352
28:09.458 --> 28:13.316
1917 for the Admiralty to organize a convoy system.

353
28:13.340 --> 28:20.074
Lloyd George had poisonous relationships with his mediocre top Generals, Robertson

354
28:20.098 --> 28:23.550
and Haig but his replacement for Robertson was no better.

355
28:23.574 --> 28:30.471
Lloyd George’s hatred of Haig went so far as to deny him reinforcements in early 1918

356
28:30.495 --> 28:37.180
(to prevent Haig launching another bloody “Big Push” offensive) which when Germany

357
28:37.204 --> 28:41.622
attacked in strength in March 1918 nearly proved fatal to the Allied cause.

358
28:41.743 --> 28:49.870
Lloyd George survived 1917 and the first half of 1918 mostly for lack of acceptable

359
28:50.002 --> 28:56.818
alternatives, then after July 1918 benefited from massive popular relief as

360
28:56.842 --> 29:02.047
the final arrival of American forces on the Western Front tipped the scale to Allied

361
29:02.071 --> 29:07.194
victory. He then secured his peacetime position by leading the Coalition into a

362
29:07.218 --> 29:12.170
landslide victory at a snap General Election, which promised the electorate a

363
29:12.194 --> 29:13.887
punitive peace against Germany.

364
29:14.038 --> 29:21.787
The period’s historical oblivion continued at the 1919 Congress of Versailles, where

365
29:21.811 --> 29:25.931
Lloyd George imposed punitive peace terms on Germany and its allies.

366
29:25.955 --> 29:32.254
Woodrow Wilson was mostly responsible for Versailles’ naivete and folly, and Georges

367
29:32.278 --> 29:38.354
Clemenceau for its vindictiveness, but Lloyd George was a prime mover in making it

368
29:38.378 --> 29:40.675
the least successful “peace” settlement in history.

369
29:40.699 --> 29:47.667
Lloyd George’s peacetime coalition was marked by industrial unrest and economic

370
29:47.691 --> 29:52.582
instability. He continued his interventionist policy, making economic

371
29:52.606 --> 29:57.642
soap operas out of every strike threat, and undertaking social and housing programs

372
29:57.744 --> 29:59.462
the country could not afford.

373
29:59.486 --> 30:04.866
His Irish policy was a vacillating mess, causing four years of civil war.

374
30:04.978 --> 30:11.450
When in 1922 scandals broke over Lloyd George’s sale of honours, there was an

375
30:11.474 --> 30:15.750
unsurprising loss of confidence in his leadership, which led to the fall of the

376
30:15.852 --> 30:21.374
Coalition – Conservatives were so thankful to break free from him that their

377
30:21.398 --> 30:25.718
back-bench organization is called the “1922 Committee” to this day.

378
30:25.742 --> 30:31.731
Lloyd George was an unpleasant man, able but corrupt and distrusted by his

379
30:31.842 --> 30:36.783
colleagues, who made some major blunders and poisoned the atmosphere of British

380
30:36.807 --> 30:40.181
politics. Overall, he was a below-average prime minister.

381
30:40.303 --> 30:43.242
Churchill

382
30:43.266 --> 30:49.704
Winston Churchill entered Parliament in 1900 as a Conservative, then crossed the

383
30:49.728 --> 30:54.720
floor to Liberal in 1904 over the issue of free trade – throughout his life, his

384
30:54.744 --> 30:57.000
economic understanding was limited.

385
30:57.024 --> 30:59.391
He entered the Cabinet in

386
30:59.415 --> 31:01.559
1908, before moving to the

387
31:01.583 --> 31:03.687
Home Office and the Admiralty.

388
31:03.711 --> 31:08.552
At the Admiralty, he built up the Navy aggressively and negotiated the purchase of

389
31:08.576 --> 31:13.335
a majority stake in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, thus ensuring oil supplies for the

390
31:13.359 --> 31:19.283
Navy. He also founded Room 40, the seed of the government’s code-breaking operations

391
31:19.307 --> 31:24.208
in the World Wars and since, now GCHQ.

392
31:24.232 --> 31:31.990
Then after war began, he promoted the idea of the 1915 Dardanelles Campaign, generally

393
31:32.014 --> 31:35.527
felt now to have been strategically sound but poorly executed.

394
31:35.551 --> 31:38.870
He was also instrumental in developing the tank.

395
31:38.894 --> 31:44.751
Churchill was brought back into the Cabinet by Lloyd George, first as Minister for

396
31:44.904 --> 31:49.318
Munitions and then as Secretary of State for War, where he favoured an aggressive

397
31:49.342 --> 31:51.638
campaign against the Russian Bolshevik government.

398
31:51.662 --> 31:59.370
When the Coalition fell, he fought the 1923 election as a Liberal on a Free Trade

399
31:59.394 --> 32:04.315
platform, then transitioned to the Conservatives, being rewarded by Baldwin

400
32:04.339 --> 32:06.575
with the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer.

401
32:06.599 --> 32:14.043
As Chancellor, he put Britain back on the Gold Standard, with an overvalued pound –

402
32:14.067 --> 32:20.042
the overvaluation could have been avoided by passing the Imperial Preference tariff

403
32:20.066 --> 32:23.163
against which he had campaigned in 1923.

404
32:23.187 --> 32:29.226
As Chancellor, Churchill also opposed defence spending as energetically as he

405
32:29.494 --> 32:32.702
supported it 15 years earlier or a decade later.

406
32:32.803 --> 32:36.610
Then he spent ten years “in the wilderness” out of office.

407
32:36.634 --> 32:43.298
Churchill’s inclusion in the government in September 1939 was inevitable and his

408
32:43.322 --> 32:48.922
ascension to the top office in May 1940 nearly so, despite his responsibility for

409
32:48.946 --> 32:50.827
the bungled Norway campaign.

410
32:50.851 --> 32:57.363
Churchill’s ability to inspire the House of Commons and the British people was a vital

411
32:57.387 --> 33:00.039
contribution over the next eighteen months.

412
33:00.063 --> 33:05.247
His personality and oratory also appealed to many Americans; they were essential in

413
33:05.271 --> 33:09.543
convincing Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a true ally and worth helping.

414
33:09.567 --> 33:16.191
Once America entered the war Churchill’s inspirational contribution was less, and he

415
33:16.215 --> 33:19.991
came close to losing office after the defeats of early 1942.

416
33:20.015 --> 33:27.382
Churchill was no great military strategist; he favoured the kind of “side-show”

417
33:27.574 --> 33:33.590
diversions from the main war effort that Pitt and Dundas had favoured in the 1790s.

418
33:33.614 --> 33:39.542
However, in one respect Churchill’s instincts were sound, in deterring the

419
33:39.664 --> 33:44.402
United States from a direct invasion of the European mainland until 1944.

420
33:44.426 --> 33:49.762
Churchill’s relationships with his military commanders were generally good.

421
33:49.786 --> 33:55.619
On the other hand, his personnel selections were sometimes flawed, notably in

422
33:55.643 --> 34:00.058
over-promoting the King’s cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten.

423
34:00.082 --> 34:06.634
His economic management during World War II was minimal – he simply allowed Clement

424
34:06.658 --> 34:10.435
Attlee, Keynes and the civil servants to build the big-government

425
34:10.459 --> 34:12.471
command economy that they wanted.

426
34:12.495 --> 34:18.207
However, there is one major blot on his record: his selection of Maynard Keynes as

427
34:18.231 --> 34:23.922
the British representative at the Bretton Woods talks in July 1944, which resulted in

428
34:23.946 --> 34:28.941
the loss of Imperial Preference and 34 years of post-war exchange controls.

429
34:29.063 --> 34:36.488
Churchill was surprised to lose the 1945 election, but since he had allowed Labour

430
34:36.512 --> 34:41.483
propagandists throughout the war to demonize the economically successful 1930s,

431
34:41.507 --> 34:43.723
a short election campaign in

432
34:43.747 --> 34:46.047
which he referred to them as

433
34:46.179 --> 34:48.192
the Gestapo did not work.

434
34:48.216 --> 34:54.580
Then he played an invaluable role with his “Iron Curtain” speech of March 1946 to

435
34:54.823 --> 34:58.700
awaken President Truman and the West to the continuing dangers

436
34:58.724 --> 35:00.200
of Stalin’s Soviet Union.

437
35:00.224 --> 35:06.310
By the time the Conservatives finally won re-election in October

438
35:06.334 --> 35:09.562
1951, Churchill was almost 77.

439
35:09.586 --> 35:15.227
In his second term in office he played a successful role in foreign policy, but once

440
35:15.251 --> 35:17.186
again economics was his weakness.

441
35:17.339 --> 35:21.702
He began badly by appointing the consensus-minded R.A.

442
35:21.726 --> 35:28.563
Butler to the Exchequer instead of the ex-City banker Oliver Lyttleton, thus

443
35:28.587 --> 35:32.991
ensuring that Socialist controls and taxes would be largely left in place.

444
35:33.015 --> 35:39.922
His biggest single mistake came in January 1952 when the Treasury, the Bank of England

445
35:39.946 --> 35:45.945
and, surprisingly, Butler, proposed Operation ROBOT, by which the pound would

446
35:45.969 --> 35:48.586
have been floated and exchange control abandoned.

447
35:48.610 --> 35:54.028
This would have allowed the British economy to grow without the painful “stop-start”

448
35:54.052 --> 35:56.267
of incessant sterling crises.

449
35:56.291 --> 36:02.266
Backed by his two most economically leftist ministers, Anthony Eden and Harold

450
36:02.290 --> 36:06.431
Macmillan, Churchill vetoed the scheme – a huge opportunity missed.

451
36:06.455 --> 36:13.798
Rationing was ended in 1954, but taxes came down only marginally.

452
36:13.822 --> 36:18.611
Part of the problem was Churchill’s excessive deference to the trade unions,

453
36:18.635 --> 36:24.843
which began the process of stagflationary labour relations surrenders that continued

454
36:24.867 --> 36:27.619
until Margaret Thatcher’s term in office.

455
36:27.643 --> 36:34.075
Even with a large boost for 18 crucial months of inspiring war leadership,

456
36:34.099 --> 36:38.442
Churchill does not rank at the top of the list, as I shall discuss below.

457
36:38.466 --> 36:40.266
Attlee

458
36:40.290 --> 36:44.483
The Attlee family were richer than the Churchills and the Attlees had much less

459
36:44.507 --> 36:46.844
expensive lifestyles.

460
36:46.868 --> 36:53.360
Thus, after Oxford, Attlee was well able to fund his East End social work and the

461
36:53.384 --> 36:57.525
early years of his political career while enjoying the occasional comfortable

462
36:57.549 --> 36:59.135
Continental vacation.

463
36:59.159 --> 37:05.631
After war service that included Gallipoli, Mesopotamia and the Western Front, Major

464
37:05.655 --> 37:09.931
Attlee turned his social work and political advocacy into a

465
37:09.955 --> 37:12.167
safe Labour seat in Limehouse.

466
37:12.191 --> 37:21.287
After its 1931 wipe-out Labour was reduced to only 46 MPs and Attlee, one of the few

467
37:21.311 --> 37:25.516
survivors not sponsored by the trades unions, was made deputy leader.

468
37:25.628 --> 37:31.451
He became leader shortly before the 1935 election, in which Labour’s position

469
37:31.475 --> 37:33.400
improved to 154 MPs.

470
37:33.512 --> 37:41.112
Attlee gained credibility with the Labour faithful by supporting the Republicans in

471
37:41.223 --> 37:42.760
the Spanish Civil War.

472
37:42.784 --> 37:49.843
Then in 1940, he made one of the leading speeches in the Norway debate that brought

473
37:49.867 --> 37:52.356
down Chamberlain and became Churchill’s deputy.

474
37:52.380 --> 37:57.595
His record during World War II deserves more attention and respect than it has

475
37:57.619 --> 38:02.581
received. He had more experience of the sharp end of modern warfare than Churchill

476
38:02.605 --> 38:06.472
himself, and the two men had usefully complementary talents.

477
38:06.496 --> 38:13.295
Attlee, while not a great speaker, was excellent at administration, detail and at

478
38:13.397 --> 38:17.436
quietening and settling clashes between the big personalities in

479
38:17.460 --> 38:19.412
the Cabinet and among the military.

480
38:19.436 --> 38:25.685
Attlee was also active in pushing Labour’s objectives for post-war reconstruction,

481
38:25.709 --> 38:33.092
seizing on the Beveridge Report when it was published in November 1942 and steering

482
38:33.116 --> 38:37.635
Butler’s 1944 Education Act onto the statute book.

483
38:37.747 --> 38:43.164
Economically, the government, mostly but not entirely through its Labour members,

484
38:43.188 --> 38:48.363
pushed further the “war socialism” of World War I, paving the way for Labour’s

485
38:48.387 --> 38:49.488
post-war policies.

486
38:49.512 --> 38:57.452
In July 1945, Attlee’s Labour party won a landslide majority – much to his surprise.

487
38:57.476 --> 39:02.955
His government came to power with a radical programme, most of which it implemented

488
39:02.979 --> 39:04.931
within three years of coming to power.

489
39:04.955 --> 39:10.373
Socially, it was much less radical; the destruction of Establishment institutions

490
39:10.397 --> 39:13.595
and traditional British attitudes came later.

491
39:13.619 --> 39:19.645
Aneurin Bevan wrote of Attlee in Tribune: “He brings to the fierce struggle of

492
39:19.669 --> 39:25.228
politics the tepid enthusiasm of a lazy summer afternoon at a cricket match.” This

493
39:25.252 --> 39:30.315
made him a highly effective leader of a radical government.

494
39:30.339 --> 39:36.365
Attlee remained an unabashed patriot in foreign policy, deciding that Britain

495
39:36.389 --> 39:41.928
needed its own nuclear deterrent, and setting up a program to create one when it

496
39:41.952 --> 39:45.296
became clear that the United States would not share its technology.

497
39:45.320 --> 39:51.717
He also believed in a long-term future for the Empire but sent the ineffably inept

498
39:51.741 --> 39:56.479
Mountbatten to India in 1947 to shepherd through Indian independence,

499
39:56.503 --> 39:58.212
at a cost of 1 million lives.

500
39:58.236 --> 40:03.788
Economically, Attlee was a Keynesian – he believed in control of the economy by an

501
40:04.455 --> 40:09.081
enlightened government, including a substantial degree of state ownership, but

502
40:09.105 --> 40:11.290
not in full public ownership of industry.

503
40:11.314 --> 40:16.305
In his time, this was forgivable; capitalism had a relatively poor track

504
40:16.329 --> 40:21.412
record in the inter-war period, while two wars had shown the allure of “war

505
40:21.436 --> 40:23.605
socialism” and government controls.

506
40:23.717 --> 40:29.013
Even in Attlee’s Edwardian youth, the British economy had underperformed other

507
40:29.037 --> 40:33.400
countries because of Britain’s persistent commitment to unilateral free trade.

508
40:33.424 --> 40:40.058
On taking office, Attlee embarked on an extensive programme of nationalization,

509
40:40.082 --> 40:45.257
beginning with the Bank of England, then coal, the railways, electricity, gas,

510
40:45.281 --> 40:50.333
airlines, long-distance road haulage and later the iron and steel industry.

511
40:50.357 --> 40:55.613
None of these nationalizations was successful; they tended to run large losses

512
40:55.637 --> 41:01.190
and acquire highly inefficient management practices, but only road haulage and iron

513
41:01.322 --> 41:05.776
and steel nationalization were reversed by Churchill’s Conservatives; the remaining

514
41:05.800 --> 41:07.624
privatisations had to wait for Thatcher.

515
41:07.776 --> 41:14.106
The Attlee government carried out two major reforms that made a major difference to

516
41:14.130 --> 41:16.538
the long-term future of the British populace.

517
41:16.562 --> 41:22.622
The National Insurance Act of 1946 established a universal compulsory national

518
41:22.733 --> 41:25.729
insurance and old age pensions system.

519
41:25.753 --> 41:33.025
The second, even more iconic to the electorate today, was the establishment in

520
41:33.049 --> 41:38.193
1948 of the National Health Service, again initially on a non-contributory basis.

521
41:38.217 --> 41:45.114
During World War II, Attlee was an effective deputy to Churchill, then after

522
41:45.138 --> 41:49.465
1945 he implemented an agenda that changed Britain forever.

523
41:49.577 --> 41:53.930
Despite the failure of his economic vision, he deserves to

524
41:53.954 --> 41:56.038
rank near the top of the list.

525
41:56.062 --> 41:57.953
Thatcher

526
41:57.977 --> 42:03.749
Margaret Thatcher’s father was a prosperous grocer who became an Alderman of their

527
42:03.773 --> 42:08.593
home town of Grantham; in politics a Gladstonian National Liberal.

528
42:08.617 --> 42:13.133
She gained a second-class degree in Chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford,

529
42:13.157 --> 42:18.888
where she was a strident, politically active Conservative in a left-wing college.

530
42:18.912 --> 42:24.425
After Oxford, she became an industrial chemist, stood twice for election in

531
42:24.556 --> 42:29.609
Dartford, married a wealthy and strongly Conservative older businessman, became a

532
42:29.633 --> 42:35.578
barrister and entered the Commons in 1959 as MP for the

533
42:35.602 --> 42:37.476
North London suburb of Finchley.

534
42:37.578 --> 42:41.445
From the start Thatcher was on the right of the party.

535
42:41.469 --> 42:48.549
She was promoted quickly to junior ministerial posts, then served in 1964-70

536
42:48.573 --> 42:50.650
in shadow economics posts.

537
42:50.782 --> 42:57.274
In 1970 she was brought into the Cabinet as Minister for Education, this being thought

538
42:57.298 --> 42:58.865
appropriate women’s work.

539
42:58.889 --> 43:04.833
Thatcher was an energetic but conventional Education Secretary, abolishing free school

540
43:04.857 --> 43:08.805
milk deliveries to protect other items of spending and proceeding with a

541
43:08.829 --> 43:12.869
comprehensive education programme in which she did not believe.

542
43:12.893 --> 43:19.749
After Edward Heath’s October 1974 second defeat, she launched what appeared a

543
43:19.773 --> 43:24.613
quixotic bid for the leadership, which she won because of the country’s desperation

544
43:24.637 --> 43:26.458
with Heath’s incompetence.

545
43:26.482 --> 43:30.866
She was not a very good Leader of the Opposition, and she was surrounded by

546
43:30.890 --> 43:35.750
colleagues who almost all disagreed with her, but already she showed the way to a

547
43:35.774 --> 43:42.286
more robust pursuit of victory in the Cold War: “I stand before you tonight in my Red

548
43:42.310 --> 43:49.653
Star chiffon evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the

549
43:49.677 --> 43:55.104
Iron Lady of the Western World” she said in a 1976 foreign policy speech.

550
43:55.128 --> 44:00.334
On gaining office, Thatcher immediately carried out two reforms that made a huge

551
44:00.358 --> 44:05.998
difference to the British economy: she reduced the top rate of income tax to 60%

552
44:06.022 --> 44:11.217
and she abolished exchange controls, in force since 1939.

553
44:11.241 --> 44:17.813
These actions alone justified her election and went beyond anything

554
44:17.837 --> 44:19.506
her predecessors had done.

555
44:19.530 --> 44:23.286
Economically, the next few years were very difficult.

556
44:23.310 --> 44:29.152
“Give me six strong men and true, and I will get through” she said on taking

557
44:29.176 --> 44:36.144
office, but later ruefully added: “Very rarely did I have as many as six.” Thatcher

558
44:36.168 --> 44:41.160
survived through sheer determination and by an enormous stroke of luck: the Argentine

559
44:41.184 --> 44:43.137
invasion of the Falkland Islands.

560
44:43.161 --> 44:49.338
Thatcher won the 1983 election by a landslide, then embarked on another test of

561
44:49.362 --> 44:52.854
her courage, the 1984-85 miners’ strike.

562
44:52.878 --> 44:57.546
Being both determined and competent she won it, though it took a year.

563
44:57.570 --> 45:03.201
By this time, immeasurably helped by Norman Tebbit she had straightened out trades

564
45:03.225 --> 45:07.349
union legislation, for the first time since Disraeli’s 1875 Act.

565
45:07.450 --> 45:13.334
During this second term Thatcher’s privatisations also moved into high gear

566
45:13.358 --> 45:18.674
with the British Telecom deal, privatizing not only industries that Attlee had

567
45:18.698 --> 45:23.761
nationalized but also those such as electricity and water supply, state-owned

568
45:23.785 --> 45:25.301
since pre-war times.

569
45:25.325 --> 45:31.625
While not always entirely successful, privatization became a trend worldwide.

570
45:31.649 --> 45:38.161
Thatcher won a third election in 1987 with a majority only slightly reduced.

571
45:38.185 --> 45:43.328
In her third term, she reduced the top rate of income tax to 40%.

572
45:43.352 --> 45:49.013
However, her attempt to replace the rates (property tax) by a personal community

573
45:49.037 --> 45:50.878
charge met with huge opposition.

574
45:50.902 --> 45:57.464
Nevertheless, by the time of her ouster, the British economy had enjoyed several

575
45:57.488 --> 46:02.095
years of rapid growth with a new focus on services, while both the public sector and

576
46:02.119 --> 46:07.302
the budget deficit had been substantially shrunk and inflation had been conquered.

577
46:07.326 --> 46:12.480
Furthermore, this period saw the fall of the Berlin Wall; her last days in office

578
46:12.504 --> 46:17.385
were spent at a Paris conference ending the Cold War and signing the largest

579
46:17.409 --> 46:19.644
disarmament agreement since World War II.

580
46:19.668 --> 46:22.229
There were inevitably mistakes.

581
46:22.253 --> 46:24.249
Three stand out:

582
46:24.400 --> 46:30.043
First, her settlement of the Rhodesia/Zimbabwe question handed the

583
46:30.067 --> 46:33.609
country over to Marxist guerrillas led by Robert Mugabe, with massacres and

584
46:33.633 --> 46:35.099
expropriation following.

585
46:35.123 --> 46:41.797
Second, her financial services legislation eliminated the traditional London merchant

586
46:41.821 --> 46:46.549
banks and produced a London financial system dominated by foreign-owned trading

587
46:46.573 --> 46:50.197
juggernauts, with many scandals and little innovation.

588
46:50.221 --> 46:53.434
Third, Europe.

589
46:53.590 --> 46:59.146
Thatcher’s Bruges speech of 1988 awakened her supporters to the danger of a unified

590
46:59.170 --> 47:04.587
European super-state, but it came both too late and too early – too late for her to

591
47:04.611 --> 47:09.887
have time to devise an alternative plan for Britain’s future and too early for her

592
47:09.911 --> 47:13.322
colleagues to wake up to the dangers, which took another generation.

593
47:13.346 --> 47:17.233
As a result, her last years were clouded by leadership challenges.

594
47:17.257 --> 47:24.195
Thatcher’s contribution to Cold War victory and her economic achievements were beyond

595
47:24.219 --> 47:26.658
anything Churchill managed.

596
47:26.682 --> 47:29.302
Even with her mistakes, she should rank near the top of this list.

597
47:29.326 --> 47:31.339
Liverpool

598
47:31.363 --> 47:36.355
I have dealt with Liverpool’s achievements at length in Tory Stories Podcast 1.

599
47:36.379 --> 47:40.469
However, I’d like to summarize his strengths against other great British Prime

600
47:40.493 --> 47:45.019
Ministers. On economics, he was clearly the best, narrowly ahead of Thatcher.

601
47:45.043 --> 47:50.217
Unlike her, he did not need to turn the economy around completely; it was already

602
47:50.241 --> 47:54.994
on the right track, but he understood industrialization and implemented policies

603
47:55.126 --> 48:00.827
to foster it, notably his Corn Laws which forced Britain to compete as a high-wage

604
48:00.851 --> 48:06.238
economy. Subsequent prime ministers’ economic policies can best be measured by

605
48:06.262 --> 48:09.085
how far they fell short of Liverpool’s; none surpassed them.

606
48:09.109 --> 48:15.399
None of the prime ministers responsible for wars were outstanding in military

607
48:15.423 --> 48:17.709
strategy, with the exception of Chatham.

608
48:17.733 --> 48:24.438
Churchill and Pitt were both misguided strategically and Lloyd George was worse,

609
48:24.462 --> 48:28.562
very nearly losing World War I by bickering with his generals.

610
48:28.586 --> 48:33.669
Liverpool, while no Chatham, came up with the strategy of steady and moderate

611
48:33.693 --> 48:38.709
pressure that would wear down Napoleon’s economically illiterate regime, and pursued

612
48:38.831 --> 48:40.590
it through several difficult years.

613
48:40.614 --> 48:45.566
While Churchill should get extra points for inspiring war leadership, the

614
48:45.590 --> 48:51.078
communications technology did not exist for Chatham, Pitt and Liverpool to achieve a

615
48:51.102 --> 48:55.334
comparable morale effect on the general public, even if they could have.

616
48:55.358 --> 49:01.759
In domestic policy, Liverpool navigated sure-footedly through the very difficult

617
49:01.783 --> 49:06.201
post-war years, then relaxed when it was possible to do so, with Peel’s criminal law

618
49:06.225 --> 49:09.795
reforms representing a substantial liberalization.

619
49:09.819 --> 49:13.787
Here several prime ministers had comparable achievements, but

620
49:13.811 --> 49:15.382
none were demonstrably superior.

621
49:15.483 --> 49:24.022
Overall, therefore, my top five prime ministers would be as follows: (Honourable

622
49:24.046 --> 49:29.838
Mentions – numbers 6-10 -- Pelham, Chatham, Palmerston, Salisbury, Asquith).

623
49:29.862 --> 49:32.595
5th: Clement Attlee.

624
49:32.619 --> 49:38.395
He gets a bonus for excellent service as Churchill’s deputy, and the sheer volume of

625
49:38.506 --> 49:41.583
changes he implemented was staggering, whatever your views on them.

626
49:41.607 --> 49:43.934
4th: William Pitt the younger.

627
49:43.958 --> 49:50.075
He was the pioneer of Industrial Revolution economics, following Gower, producing an

628
49:50.099 --> 49:55.293
excellent recovery from the American War and a highly productive period to 1792.

629
49:55.317 --> 49:58.485
However, he was not an especially good war leader.

630
49:58.509 --> 50:01.019
3rd: Winston Churchill.

631
50:01.043 --> 50:06.795
His reputation was overblown in the early decades after World War II because of his

632
50:06.819 --> 50:09.399
inspirational morale-boosting war leadership.

633
50:09.423 --> 50:11.774
(Attlee was a far better administrator).

634
50:11.925 --> 50:16.725
His post-war term of office was no more than competent, and not always that.

635
50:16.749 --> 50:19.501
2nd: Margaret Thatcher.

636
50:19.525 --> 50:25.085
She gets extra points because of the appalling situation she inherited, and the

637
50:25.109 --> 50:27.730
mess her successors have made since she departed.

638
50:27.754 --> 50:32.158
Her economic changes were huge, albeit alas not permanent.

639
50:32.182 --> 50:36.266
Like all these five leaders, she gets extra points for character.

640
50:36.377 --> 50:40.994
And 1st: Robert Banks Jenkinson, Lord Liverpool.

641
50:41.018 --> 50:48.078
Others exceeded him in individual areas, but for all-round successful leadership in

642
50:48.102 --> 50:53.016
a very difficult period of unprecedented change, he deserves to rank No. 1

643
50:53.040 --> 50:55.941
Thank you very much for listening.

644
50:55.965 --> 51:00.062
That is the end of Tory Stories Podcast No. 5
