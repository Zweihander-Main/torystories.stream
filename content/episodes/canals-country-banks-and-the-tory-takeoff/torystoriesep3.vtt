<v 1>These Tory Stories podcasts aim to act as modest</v>

2
00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.620
counters to the almost universal Whig version of history,

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.060
observing history and the world from the point of view of an 18th century Tory.

4
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.020
Their particular focus will be on the Industrial Revolution and the

5
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.620
Tory achievements of 1660 to 1832.

6
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.260
Tory Story 3: Canals, Country Banks,

7
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.220
and the Tory Takeoff. The thesis of my book,

8
00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.100
"Forging Modernity" is that the Industrial Revolution resulted from

9
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.740
unique British policies pursued over more than a century.

10
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:49.780
In this podcast,

11
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.180
I'd like to focus on the exact moment of economic takeoff: the late 1760s --

12
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.814
pick

13
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.300
1767 or 1768 if you want a particular year --

14
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.100
and look at how that period's Tory policies mixed

15
00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:10.580
with some major structural changes in the British economy that caused

16
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.459
liftoff and changed the world forever.

17
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.060
Let's begin by looking at the British economy in 1760.

18
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.620
The Whigs had been in power for 46 years without a break,

19
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.660
a period of rule since christened un-ironically, the Whig supremacy.

20
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.620
During that period,

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.819
the modest steps taken towards industrialization before 1714

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.660
had not progressed much.

23
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.500
Sir Ambrose Crowley's Crowley Ironworks, the first real factory,

24
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.900
is still in business in 1760 but hasn't expanded.

25
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.180
It's currently being managed by his redoubtable daughter-in-law Theodosia

26
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.930
after his son died in 1728.

27
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.730
Two other early factories in the textile sector, Lombe's Mill,

28
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.970
weaving silk in Derby and Marvel's Mill in Northampton,

29
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.610
using an early version of the spinning frame later used by Arkwright,

30
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.810
are in business, but not very profitable.

31
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.970
Marvel's Mill will go out of business in 1761.

32
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.620
Abraham Darby II has improved the coke-fired process for

33
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.500
smelting pig iron that his father invented in 1709 and

34
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:31.820
expanded the business, but he's now wrapped up in lawsuits,

35
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:35.100
although others are starting to use the technology.

36
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.580
John "Iron-Mad" Wilkinson opens his Brosely smelter in

37
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.740
1757. Finally,

38
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.980
there are quite a lot of Newcomen-type steam engines around --

39
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.740
from its invention in 1712 there were already 110 in 1733 --

40
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.020
but the technology has not moved on,

41
00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.800
so their use is largely confined to pumping water out of coal mines.

42
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.800
Their motion is very erratic so nobody has figured out a way of using them to

43
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:08.840
operate machinery.

44
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.370
There were several reasons for this lack of progress.

45
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.850
The Whigs were London centered,

46
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.650
favoring the cosmopolitan financial markets and neglecting the provinces.

47
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.010
They offered lucrative get rich quick opportunities outside the hard

48
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.930
slog of industry in slave owning sugar and tobacco plantations,

49
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.650
the financial markets and the looting of the East

50
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:35.530
India company.

51
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.130
They suppressed working class initiative with punitive legislation and

52
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.243
policies.

53
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.450
They were hugely protectionist and oriented towards vested interests,

54
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.290
preventing new entrants from entering markets.

55
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.370
Only in the late 1750s with the Pitt and Newcastle government

56
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.810
did the economic and political repression of the preceding 40 years begin to

57
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:06.400
open somewhat. Then in October 1760,

58
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.040
the aged George II,

59
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.080
who like his father had insisted on only Whig governments,

60
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.520
he died and his grandson,

61
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.960
the young George III succeeded to the throne. George,

62
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.520
the third had been brought up in an atmosphere of opposition to the Whigs.,

63
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.080
His tutors, Simon Earl Harcour,

64
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.360
and James 3rd Earl Bute were both Tories.

65
00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:37.279
Also he'd studied Bolingbroke's "On the idea of a Patriot King",

66
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.800
which set out what a Tory government should aim for.

67
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.120
Tory policy while focused on "Church and King" was anti-metropolitan, open

68
00:04:48.081 --> 00:04:50.160
to the provinces, anti-corruption,

69
00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:56.240
open to the working classes and believed in a "blue water" foreign policy

70
00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.440
increasing Britain's trading potential rather than endless involvement in

71
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.513
European wars.

72
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.339
George II's Tory proclivities were revealed by bringing

73
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.339
Bute into the government in March 1761,

74
00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.020
fighting an election in that year,

75
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.500
in which Tories were able to gain seats in better proportion to their national

76
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:20.334
support.

77
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.140
Then he made Bute prime minister in May 1762,

78
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.940
forcing out the Duke of Newcastle,

79
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.020
who'd been in high ministerial office in 1717,

80
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.740
and forcing out a whole host of Whig officials who'd grown lazy and

81
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.300
arrogant in their sinecures.

82
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.500
This was greeted with widespread rejoicingl Thomas Arne wrote an

83
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.500
opera "Artaxerxes" to celebrate it,

84
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.700
and as the splendid Tory MP for Oxford university,

85
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.940
Sir Roger Newdigate said: "men must love peace,

86
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.240
men proscribed and abused for 50 years should be presented with

87
00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.880
fools' caps if they make ladders for tyrant Whigs to mount

88
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.803
by."

89
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.640
The left Whiggish American colonies would become increasingly

90
00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:16.200
disgruntled from this change but ordinary people outside London mostly

91
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.143
rejoiced.

92
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.600
So much for Sir Lewis Namier's dotty theory that there were no political

93
00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:23.839
parties at this time!

94
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.279
Bute's Peace of Paris in 1763 was also popular

95
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.600
though Whigs and their hangers on in the media groused about its terms --

96
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:36.800
Canada, Florida,

97
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.320
and India were to them a grossly inadequate return for their Whig war;

98
00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:45.160
they wanted the slave economy Guadalupe as well.

99
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.200
Bute did not last long, but from now on governments would be truly mixed.

100
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.760
Except for brief interludes in 1765 to 67 and

101
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.680
1782 to 83,

102
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.520
all ministries would have a healthy admixture of Tories and some,

103
00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:08.440
notably those of North and later that of Pitt, would be Tory dominated.

104
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.080
The Tory dominance was extended through the legal system by the work of

105
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.600
Sir William Blackstone,

106
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.440
who 1765 to 70 "Commentaries on the Law of England"

107
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.560
codified the common law,

108
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.200
making it available to literate people from all backgrounds.

109
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.230
What did the Tory re-entry mean for the economy? Well, for a start,

110
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.030
it meant better economic policy.

111
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.670
The Tories were more free trading than the early 18th century Whigs.

112
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.310
They believed in a global Britain oriented to worldwide trading

113
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.190
opportunities with a "blue water" foreign policy and without significant

114
00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:54.550
ambitions in European power politics. For example,

115
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.430
in 1774,

116
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.590
they removed the restrictions on importing or even manufacturing

117
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.230
patterned cotton fabrics that had been imposed by the Whigs in

118
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.303
1720.

119
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.510
Without this change it's doubtful that Sir Richard Arkwright's textile business,

120
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.430
new machinery and all,

121
00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:18.910
could have grown to the size it did and inspired the first explosive growth

122
00:08:18.911 --> 00:08:21.070
sector of the Industrial Revolution.

123
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.250
Most important economically, policies no longer favored London ,

124
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.530
slave enabled economies, and the Whiggish moneyed interest financers.

125
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.770
Instead the great mass of the country, including provincial towns,

126
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.530
emerging manufacturing districts,

127
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.610
and rural areas gained a voice in policy and were able to further their

128
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.650
interests. In general, as discussed in podcast number two,

129
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.440
the Tories of this period were followers of the Oxfordfordshire School of

130
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.200
Economic Thought and Lord North of course,

131
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.040
was related to one of that school's central figures,

132
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.040
the economist Sir Dudley North.

133
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.610
The political revolution at George the Third's accession helped

134
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.450
kickstart the Industrial Revolution, pushing it into full swing.

135
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.290
The most significant datum is the rate of patents filed;

136
00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:23.330
having averaged 5.7 patents per annum in the first

137
00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:28.250
half of the 18th century and ticked up to 9.2 per annum in the

138
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.130
1750s, they more than doubled to 20.5 per annum,

139
00:09:33.131 --> 00:09:38.010
in the 1760s increasing further to 29.4

140
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:38.820
per annum,

141
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.330
in the 1770s and 47.7 per annum in the

142
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.403
1780s.

143
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.450
The 1760s also saw a trebling in parliamentary enclosures.

144
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:55.010
The number of Enclosure Acts from 117 in the

145
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.370
1750s to 393 in the 1760s,

146
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.970
and then rising further to 640 in the 1770s

147
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.929
dropping back thereafter.

148
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.650
This is a sign that agriculture was also becoming much more market oriented.

149
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.483
The Tory dominance

150
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.890
of politics was reflected in North's ministry and later in those of Pitt and his

151
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:20.650
successors down to Lord Liverpool.

152
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.250
Charles Jenkinson later first Earl of Liverpool,

153
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.370
the prime minister's father was also an increasingly important influence on

154
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.890
economic policy although until 1786, he was in subordinate posts.

155
00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:37.012
However,

156
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.970
this period's most important Tory in economic matters was Granville Leveson

157
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:46.770
Gower, which is pronounced 'Looshun-gore' for some reason, second Earl

158
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.650
Gower, and from 1786, first Marquess of Stafford.

159
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.490
Gower was appointed to the top Court office of Lord Chamberlain by Bute in

160
00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:59.650
1763,

161
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.890
and in the cabinet almost continuously from 1767 to

162
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:06.963
1794.

163
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:12.290
Gower has been utterly neglected by biographers over the 219 years since his

164
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:12.910
death,

165
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.809
but he played several crucial roles in the Industrial Revolution as

166
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.643
participan,

167
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.330
organizer and cabinet voice of sound policy for three decades.

168
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.630
In a very 18th century arrangement,

169
00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:32.630
his agent Thomas Gilbert also became Tory MP for

170
00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:35.470
Newcastle under Lyme in 1762,

171
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.590
sponsored "Gilbert's Act" an important measure of social legislation in

172
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.663
1782,

173
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.950
and ended as chairman of the house of commons ways and means committee for 10

174
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:47.910
years under Pitt.

175
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.640
By this means Gower retained the maximum influence over fiscal and economic

176
00:11:53.641 --> 00:11:56.720
policy without having to neglect his estates.

177
00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.730
At his death, Gower's estates were worth 2 million pounds,

178
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.730
the fifth richest man in the country.

179
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:10.330
His Whiggish eldest son who inherited the Duke of Bridgewater's estate,

180
00:12:10.531 --> 00:12:12.010
as well as his father's,

181
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.050
thereby became the country's richest man and was created First Duke of

182
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:22.050
Sutherland in 1833 without any great distinction of his own beyond being

183
00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:22.884
a Whig.

184
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.500
Gower's involvement in industrialization began in 1758,

185
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.740
when he employed a consulting engineer, James Brindley,

186
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.380
at a retainer of a hundred pounds a year to survey a route for a canal

187
00:12:40.381 --> 00:12:42.500
to join the rivers Trent and Mersey.

188
00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.740
Brindley was the son of a deeply rural farmer,

189
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.100
self taught through apprenticeship to a wheelwright in Macclesfield, Cheshire.

190
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.900
He'd been in business for some two decades, building mills,

191
00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.900
mine pumping equipment and other projects, mostly involving water,

192
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:05.100
either as a power source or as a nuisance to be removed.

193
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.660
He worked primarily in wood rather than metal,

194
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.820
but alas his attempt to produce a steam engine with a wood cylinder that

195
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.809
improved on Newcomen was not successful. Naturally,

196
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.970
he'd been involved in projects on Gower's extensive Staffordshire estates.

197
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.770
Thus when Gower wanted to see the practicability of a Trent and Mersey canal

198
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.250
serving the whole of Staffordshire and neighboring counties,

199
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:38.530
Brindley who knew Gower's agent Thomas Gilbert well was the obvious man to

200
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:39.364
hire.

201
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.950
The economic benefits of canals for transporting heavy goods were simple.

202
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.550
Given the roads of this period,

203
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.190
half a century before Thomas Telford and John McAdam improved them,

204
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.870
the maximum load for a horse drawn car was about two tons

205
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.150
and that required two men to lever the cart out of innumerable potholes or

206
00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:08.670
rescue it when it ran off the road. Progress would be slow at best.

207
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.750
However a canal narrow boat as would be used on Brindley's

208
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:19.270
canals could carry 50 tons of goods and required the same

209
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:21.390
horse and the same two men:

210
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.670
one to guide the barge and the other to tame the horse.

211
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.470
Canals were therefore potentially about 25 times as productive as

212
00:14:30.471 --> 00:14:33.190
road transport for heavy goods, such as coal.

213
00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.030
This was a revolutionary advantage,

214
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.110
far more significant than the advantage brought about by most steam engine

215
00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:45.870
applications, other than pumping water, until about 1810.

216
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.680
The biggest problem facing Gower and Brindley was that a Trent and Mersey

217
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.720
canal being 93 miles long was beyond the resources

218
00:14:57.721 --> 00:15:00.960
of even the wealthy Gower. In any case,

219
00:15:00.961 --> 00:15:05.520
such a canal would benefit businesses far beyond Gower's own holdings,

220
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.320
such as the emerging pottery manufacturers around Stroke-on-Trent.

221
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.840
However, in 1748,

222
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.800
Gower had married the sister of Francis Egerton, third Duke of Bridgewater.

223
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.080
If canals were viable,

224
00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:26.040
they could be used to ship coal from Bridgewater's mines at Worsley

225
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:31.080
to the rapidly growing city of Manchester, a much shorter canal,

226
00:15:31.081 --> 00:15:35.520
initially 10 miles that would bring most of its benefits to Bridgewater

227
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.403
himself.

228
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:43.360
Either Gower proposed the canal idea to Bridgewater or Bridgewater got to

229
00:15:43.361 --> 00:15:46.920
hear of Gower and Brindley's idea through his agent, John Gilbert,

230
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.720
who was Thomas Gilbert's brother.

231
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.280
In any case Bridgewater hired Brindley to work on his canal.

232
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.760
Since Bridgewater was paying for the entire canal,

233
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.320
it was built on a grand scale with a 15 foot width,

234
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:06.120
a tunnel through the mountain at Worsley to load directly from the coal face

235
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:11.160
and a much admired Barton aqueduct bridge over the river

236
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.480
Irwell. During his work on the Bridgewater canal,

237
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:20.400
Brindley invented puddling: a technique for mixing clay,

238
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.760
sand and water to produce a waterproof bottom for canals.

239
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.200
He demonstrated this technique messily,

240
00:16:28.201 --> 00:16:33.160
but successfully before a select committee of the house of commons in

241
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.880
1762, while promoting the extension to Bridgewater's canal.

242
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:44.490
The Bridgewater canal's initial phase was built quickly at a cost of

243
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.370
168,000 pounds (at 16,800 per mile),

244
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.210
and was opened in 1761,

245
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.730
halving the price of coal in Manchester and being so profitable for Bridgewater

246
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.650
that he immediately commissioned an extension to the Mersey at Runcorn

247
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.050
that would allow shipping from Worsely to the port of Liverpool.

248
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:11.130
The full project cost over 300,000 pounds stretching even

249
00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:15.410
Bridgewaters finances and forcing him to borrow from his bankers.

250
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.880
Already before 1760, with the encouragement of Gower,

251
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:27.000
Brindley had planned a grand cross canal system to link the

252
00:17:27.001 --> 00:17:29.600
Trent, Mersey, Severn and Thames rivers --

253
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:35.080
the Trent amd Mersey would be the most important first leg of this

254
00:17:35.081 --> 00:17:37.920
plan. If this could be achieved,

255
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.680
the entire Midlands would be opened up sharply,

256
00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:43.560
reducing the cost of heavy goods,

257
00:17:43.561 --> 00:17:47.800
such as coal and enabling the products of Staffordshire's potteries,

258
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.840
the West Midlands iron working businesses,

259
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.359
and Birmingham's toy manufacturing to sell cost

260
00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.119
competitively, both throughout Britain and through the ports of London,

261
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.400
Liverpool and Bristol throughout the world.

262
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:08.000
Once the first section of the Bridgewater canal was opened and it's

263
00:18:08.001 --> 00:18:09.600
construction much admired,

264
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.640
it was available as a demonstration project to help in financing other canals.

265
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.500
Other Dukes took note of the Bridgewater's canal success,

266
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.380
but so did non-ducal businessmen who realized that the cost of a local

267
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:31.300
canal was well within the financial reach of local merchants and industrialists

268
00:18:31.821 --> 00:18:36.820
banding together while the benefits of a canal for heavy goods transport

269
00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.100
as an alternative to horse-drawn haulage over muddy roads were potentially

270
00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:47.060
immense. Naturally Brindley was involved in most of the early canals,

271
00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.500
particularly in the Midlands.

272
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:54.180
Since they were funded by share issues and debt from local tradesman and gentry,

273
00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:59.780
Brindley's canals were built on a less luxurious scale than the Bridgewater

274
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:05.100
with only a seven foot width and winding routes that followed the contours of

275
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:09.940
the land to avoid expensive locks and even more expensive

276
00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:14.380
tunnels and aqueducts. As a result of Bridley's canal design,

277
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:19.340
the standard canal narrow boat was 70 feet long and seven feet

278
00:19:19.341 --> 00:19:20.174
wide.

279
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.700
One such businessman was Josiah Wedgwood who had opened his own Ivy Works

280
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.100
pottery in 1759 and fired by the success of his creamware

281
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.140
was rapidly becoming both locally prominent and quite wealthy.

282
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:40.500
He sold a dinner service to Gower in 1764 and learned

283
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.940
about the projected canals at an all day dinner with Gower, Brindley,

284
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.780
and the two Gilberts.

285
00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:52.780
Wedgwood quickly realized that Trent and Mersey canal would revolutionize his

286
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.869
business.

287
00:19:53.869 --> 00:19:58.420
It would make raw materials such as kaolin from new deposits in Cornwall

288
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.859
cheaper to obtain.

289
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.340
It would also greatly reduce breakages on China shipments to London and

290
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.733
elsewhere.

291
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.100
The roads around his pottery in Burslem were particularly bad since

292
00:20:12.101 --> 00:20:15.980
local potters dug them up for the red clay, an essentially ingredient.

293
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.900
Wedgwood became a salesman for the canal,

294
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.619
traveling around the Midlands and introducing other businessmen to the idea

295
00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:29.420
notably Matthew Boulton and through him other members of the embryonic

296
00:20:29.421 --> 00:20:33.340
Birmingham Lunar society in fully existence from

297
00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:37.540
1765, but coming together for some years before then.

298
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.160
With Midland's businessmen energized, not one,

299
00:20:43.161 --> 00:20:47.560
but two canals were authorized by the same act of parliament in

300
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.960
May, 1766. Gower and Thomas Gilbert were sponsors of this legislation,

301
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.640
which was steered through the weak Whig administration of the Marquess of

302
00:20:58.641 --> 00:21:02.840
Rockingham who doubtless hoped to get Gower's support by allowing through his

303
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.993
favorite project.

304
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.440
In the event the following administration of William Pitt Earl of Chatham

305
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
and Augustus Fitzroy third duke of Grafton admitted Gower to the nine

306
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.240
man cabinet as lord president of the council in December, 1767,

307
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.080
making the cabinet distinctly more Tory by doing so.

308
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.480
The two canals were the Trent and Mersey canal and the Staffordshire and

309
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.680
Worcestershire canal, both surveyed by Brindley,

310
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.400
which ran from the Severm to connect with the Trent and Mersey.

311
00:21:37.609 --> 00:21:39.040
By these two canals,

312
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.080
three quarters of Brindley's "Grand Cross" scheme was fulfilled with the Trent,

313
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:47.520
Mersey, and Severn rivers being connected.

314
00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:54.320
A share issue for the Staffordshire and Worcestershire raised a hundred thousand

315
00:21:54.321 --> 00:21:58.200
pounds of equity of which 70,000 was paid up immediately.

316
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.200
The canal was finished in 1771 and opened traffic in

317
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.313
1772.

318
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.160
It was 46 miles long linking the river Severn at Stourport

319
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.920
with the Trent and Mersey canal at Haywood Junction.

320
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:18.800
It followed natural contours as far as possible minimizing artifacts,

321
00:22:18.801 --> 00:22:20.520
but making it longer than necessary.

322
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.680
Its cost per mile was 2,168 pounds,

323
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.000
the lowest of the early canals.

324
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.560
The canal would carry coal from nearby mines to the iron works of

325
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:37.000
John Wilkinson and Abraham Darby III and pottery from

326
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:39.680
Staffordshire to Bristol's international shipping trade.

327
00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:45.240
It was an immediate financial success and in 1828 paid a dividend

328
00:22:45.241 --> 00:22:50.240
of 40 pounds on each hundred pound share for which 140 was eventually

329
00:22:50.241 --> 00:22:53.760
paid up, the shares selling at 800 pounds per share.

330
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.690
When the Trent and Mersey canal was authorized in

331
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.890
1766,

332
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.690
66,900 of the authorized share capital of 130,000

333
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:10.730
had been subscribed. By further acts of parliament another

334
00:23:12.369 --> 00:23:15.970
166,000 pounds was borrowed by the canal as it ran into cost overruns,

335
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.850
making a total debt and equity capital of 296,000.

336
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.010
Josiah Wedgwood cut the first sod of soil at the massive celebration on

337
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.283
26th of July, 1766.

338
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:35.210
The canal was 93 miles long from Preston Brook where it meets the

339
00:23:35.211 --> 00:23:39.330
Bridgewater canal to the river Trent at Derwent Mouth in Derbyshire.

340
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.930
By 1771, when Wedgwood Etruria factory opened,

341
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.880
most of the the canal had been built to Preston Brook as had the Eastern section

342
00:23:48.881 --> 00:23:50.440
from Burslem to the Trent.

343
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.960
The remaining obstacle was Kidsgrove hill near Stoke-on-Trent

344
00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.640
under which the canal drove the 2,880 yard Harecastle

345
00:24:01.201 --> 00:24:06.119
Tunnel through which boatman propelled the boats by foot lying on their

346
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.953
backs.

347
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.680
The canal's economics were helped by Kidsgrove Hill proving to consist largely

348
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.880
of coal, which was mined by the Golden Hill colliery,

349
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.359
partly owned by Brindley.

350
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.240
Since Kidsgrove stood at the canal's high point,

351
00:24:21.619 --> 00:24:26.240
the steam engine pumping out the mine supplied the necessary water to the

352
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:30.119
canal. Even with this tunnel, the canal's cost was a modest

353
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.080
3,213 pounds per mile. The full canal was opened in 1777;

354
00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:39.640
Like the Staffordshire and Worcestershire,

355
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.960
the Trent and Mersey canal was immediately financially successful,

356
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:49.080
paying off its bonded debt and at the 1825 peak

357
00:24:49.801 --> 00:24:54.400
sold for 4,000 pounds per 200 pound share paying an

358
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.400
annual dividend of 150 pounds. The

359
00:24:59.411 --> 00:25:03.810
third spectacularly successful canal was the Birmingham Canal

360
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.570
authorized by parliament in February,

361
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.369
1768 with sponsorship from Matthew Boulton and the Lunar society,

362
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.050
to run from Birmingham to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal,

363
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:16.290
near Wolverhampton,

364
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:21.930
on a Brindley plan which was largely level but meandering with branches to

365
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.770
Ocker Hill and Wednesbury where there were coalmines.

366
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.530
500 shares of 140 pounds were subscribed for a total of 70,000.

367
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.650
The cost over run to an eventual cost of

368
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.890
112,400 pounds or

369
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.570
4,091 pounds per mile was covered by short term loans and subventions for

370
00:25:43.571 --> 00:25:46.890
running profits. The first building was to Wednesbury,

371
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.450
where upon as in Manchester a few years earlier,

372
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.450
the price of household coal in Birmingham halved overnight;

373
00:25:55.109 --> 00:25:59.850
the full canal of nearly 23 miles was completed in 1772,

374
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.810
just before Brindley's death. There were two separate terminals in Birmingham,

375
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.770
as well as a branch to Boulton's Soho manufactory.

376
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.250
The Birmingham canal borrowed another 121,400

377
00:26:13.891 --> 00:26:18.850
pounds from 1784 to 98 to construct the Birmingham

378
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.050
and Fazeley canal, which connected with the Coventry canal.

379
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.970
This money was repaid between 1800 and 1819.

380
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.530
With this additional leverage and new asset,

381
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:34.330
the canal's 140 pound shares were already selling at 900 in

382
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.609
1792 and were divided into eighths;

383
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:43.010
by 1828 an eighth share was selling for 300 pounds while

384
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.280
dividends were a hundred percent on the original 140 pound shares.

385
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.930
Four other canals were authorized by parliament during this initial burst

386
00:26:52.931 --> 00:26:56.170
between 1766 and 1770,

387
00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.450
but their completion was delayed in all four cases by the American war,

388
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:03.690
so they were less spectacularly successful.

389
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:09.210
Two of them were outside the Midlands so not part of Brindley's grand

390
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.044
cross,

391
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:15.170
the Forth and Clyde canal with no Brindley involvement was authorized

392
00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:18.250
in 1768 with capital of 200,000 pounds;

393
00:27:18.251 --> 00:27:22.850
its 35 miles between the two Firths was not

394
00:27:22.851 --> 00:27:27.050
completed until 1790 and it was only modestly successful.

395
00:27:27.869 --> 00:27:29.850
The other non Midlands canal,

396
00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:33.290
the Leeds and Liverpool canal was the longest in Britain,

397
00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:37.290
initially 116 miles along a Brindley proposed route.

398
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.369
Authorized in May,

399
00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:45.170
1770 it was delayed by not one but two wars so not completed until

400
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.210
1816. However,

401
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.490
despite an astronomical final cost of 1.2 million pounds and

402
00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.930
multiple fundraisings, it was eventually successfu,

403
00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:00.170
its hundred pound shares selling at 470 by

404
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.283
1829.

405
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:06.490
The Leeds and Liverpool canal proved central in supplying coal to the Lancashire

406
00:28:07.011 --> 00:28:10.890
textile industry once that industry became steam powered.

407
00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:17.570
The other two grand cross canals were the Coventry canal and the

408
00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:18.410
Oxford canal.

409
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:23.530
The Conventry canal authorized in 1768 runs 38

410
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:28.290
miles south from the Trent and Mersey at Fradley junction to Coventry,

411
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.290
taking in the Atherstone Colliery as you would.

412
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.810
It was underfunded and Brindley was fired in 1771 since his

413
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:38.730
construction standards were too high.

414
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.730
It then ran out of money and was not completed until 1790.

415
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.770
However its shares were selling at 610 pounds per hundred by

416
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.330
1834. Finally,

417
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:55.730
the Oxford canal authorized in 1769,

418
00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.690
sponsored by its chairman,

419
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:03.010
the splendid Sir Roger Newdigate runs 78 miles from

420
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:07.170
Hawkesbury Lock on the Coventry canal to the Thames at Oxford,

421
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.490
thus completing Brindley's grand cross vision by connecting the system

422
00:29:12.491 --> 00:29:14.730
to the Thames. Again,

423
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:19.570
designed by Brindley it was plagued by cost overruns and only competed in

424
00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:20.643
1790,

425
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:25.650
but even in that year Sir Roger was getting a dividend return of a

426
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:27.810
hundred percent on his initial investment,

427
00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.650
which return at his death in 1806 funded Oxford

428
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:37.250
university's Newdigate Prize for English Verse Composition!

429
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:42.680
The canal's spectacular profitability lessened after 1805,

430
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:47.240
when the Grand Junction canal provided a broader, more direct link to London,

431
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.200
but the shares were still trading at 670 per hundred in

432
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.273
1829.

433
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.640
Brindley's last years were busy ones galloping on his horse,

434
00:29:59.641 --> 00:30:04.640
across the Midlands from canal to canal surveying the progress of works on

435
00:30:04.641 --> 00:30:05.474
each one.

436
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.080
It probably hastened his death in 1772 at the age of only 56.

437
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.560
Nevertheless, even by his death,

438
00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:16.640
he could be confident that his vision will be fulfilled and with the first two

439
00:30:16.641 --> 00:30:21.360
canals already opened the gigantic benefits from his grand cross

440
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.280
plan were already apparent.

441
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.670
There were three great surges in canal building:

442
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:32.550
this period of roughly 1766 to 77 before the American war,

443
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.630
the late 1780s before the Napoleonic wars and 1816 to

444
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:40.550
25 after the Napoleonic wars ended.

445
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.590
Finance was expensive and difficult to obtain during war time.

446
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.870
Of the three surges this first one saw the highest profitability and the

447
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.910
greatest economic effect since the best projects were attempted first.

448
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.790
The second surge authorized in the late 1780s,

449
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.630
mostly ran into cost overruns after a 22 year war started

450
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.070
in 1793;

451
00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.390
some were finished only after debilitating wartime capital raising while others

452
00:31:09.391 --> 00:31:11.990
were abandoned halfway. Finally,

453
00:31:11.991 --> 00:31:16.550
the 1816 to 25 surge of canal building suffered from poor

454
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.350
economic returns because its canals economic lives were artificially

455
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.590
curtailed by the coming of the railways.

456
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:29.430
This first surge of canal building was thus by far the most economically

457
00:31:29.431 --> 00:31:33.510
important with the most important and profitable canals,

458
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.590
all receiving parliamentary authorization between

459
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:39.950
1766 and 1770.

460
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:45.310
Their exceptional returns demonstrate their direct economic importance

461
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.790
though their multiplier effect on the economy as a whole was also huge.

462
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.750
By their effect on the economy's logistics,

463
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.310
for example halving the price of coal in Birmingham and Manchester,

464
00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:02.070
the canals vastly improved the economics of the early coal

465
00:32:02.071 --> 00:32:03.590
guzzling steam engines.

466
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:09.150
Thereby the Brindley canals set off an acceleration in activity that

467
00:32:09.151 --> 00:32:10.950
became the Industrial Revolution.

468
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.870
James Watts's advances in steam engine technology

469
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.630
were just part of this.

470
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.430
James Brindley has a better claim than Watt to be called the Industrial

471
00:32:22.431 --> 00:32:23.630
Revolution's father.

472
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:31.070
The other vital catalyst for the Industrial Revolution that also came to

473
00:32:31.071 --> 00:32:35.230
fruition in the 1760s was the emergence of country banks.

474
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:41.520
Banking services in 17th century England had grown out of two sources:

475
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.800
scriveners (specialists in creating written documents with a Guild established

476
00:32:47.801 --> 00:32:52.760
in 1373) and goldsmiths. Scrivener bankers,

477
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.200
of whom the most famous was Clayton and Morris,

478
00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:00.440
had documents expertise so specialized in providing

479
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.280
mortgages for country gentry for which they could undertake the necessary record

480
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.520
searches and keeping cash on their behalf.

481
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.960
The original scriveners had provided this service for sheep drovers,

482
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.480
bringing their flocks to London and selling them there.

483
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:22.850
Goldsmith bankers made money from providing gold and silver plate to the

484
00:33:22.851 --> 00:33:27.210
very rich and the Royal court and dealing in foreign trade instruments.

485
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.250
They became specialists in government bond markets when those markets appeared

486
00:33:32.251 --> 00:33:33.530
in the 1690s.

487
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.690
This was initially an excessively lucrative business that caused them to

488
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:43.610
grow at the expense of Scrivener bankers. During the Whig supremacy,

489
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.210
almost all banking was carried out in London with city bankers

490
00:33:48.211 --> 00:33:53.130
specializing in the markets and west end bankers specializing in what

491
00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:55.290
we now call private banking for the very rich.

492
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.210
By the Bank of England Act 1708,

493
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.210
no bank other than the Bank of England was allowed to have more than six

494
00:34:04.211 --> 00:34:05.044
partners.

495
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.969
This didn't matter to the Goldsmith bankers who became very rich and snooty

496
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:13.130
like the merchant banks of 1914. However,

497
00:34:13.131 --> 00:34:17.610
there was a huge void in providing financial services to the gentry

498
00:34:17.611 --> 00:34:20.489
tradesmen and other ordinary people outside London.

499
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:22.770
After 1750,

500
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.450
this void began to be filled by the creation of local country banks.

501
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:33.050
One such country bank, Smiths of Nottingham was founded in 1688,

502
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.370
but there don't appear to have been any others before 1750.

503
00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:41.730
These country banks had a business mix like the old Scrivener

504
00:34:42.451 --> 00:34:46.410
bankers but were concentrated in one provincial town, their headquarters.

505
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:51.969
They were typically set up by local attorneys with partners drawn from the most

506
00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:56.489
prosperous local tradesmen and had modest capital normally below 10,000 pounds.

507
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:03.300
Country banks' legal setup affected how they did business.

508
00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:08.460
They could not grow much because their capital was so limited and until the

509
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.460
1826 crisis each year's profits were normally paid out as dividends to partners.

510
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.020
They did not have many posh,

511
00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:20.140
wealthy landowners as partners because of unlimited liability.

512
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.260
The unhappy experience of two Scottish Dukes among

513
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.980
114 partners of the Ayr bank (there was no partner limitation in Scotland)

514
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.380
who were pursued until the 1820s by creditors from its collapse

515
00:35:36.381 --> 00:35:41.360
in 1772) showed the downside of being the richest partner in a

516
00:35:41.361 --> 00:35:42.280
bank that went wrong.

517
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:47.719
They did no long term lending because the Usury Act of 1714

518
00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:50.719
prevented them from charging interest of more than five percent --

519
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.560
no junk bond market therefore. However,

520
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.239
unlike the American local banks,

521
00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.200
after the 1836 de-chartering of the second bank of the United States,

522
00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.080
the country banks' bank notes normally traded at par,

523
00:36:06.469 --> 00:36:08.200
even outside their region.

524
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:13.200
This was achieved by each country bank employing a London correspondent

525
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.640
who acted as a clearing house for its notes of banks from other regions.

526
00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:20.052
Overall,

527
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.410
as well as providing services to private individuals and institutions,

528
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:30.210
country banks provided a wide range of services to nascent industrialization

529
00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:34.530
which would've been greatly hindered by their absence. First,

530
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:37.890
there was the simple matter of introductions to financing sources.

531
00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.770
The banks generally didn't provide venture capital directly,

532
00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.410
but their partners and wealthy customers might.

533
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:50.770
Discounting bills of exchange and thereby providing liquidity

534
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.170
was often the main introductory service,

535
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:58.410
but paying wages to workers in local bank notes and providing receivables

536
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:02.489
financing through discounting were all common. In addition,

537
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.410
the country banker might provide inventory and other financing through overdraft

538
00:37:07.691 --> 00:37:12.250
facilities to the businesses owners generally secured by promisary notes

539
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:17.489
often for double the amount of the loan facility or secured by mortgages,

540
00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:21.850
which were highly illiquid but represented a claim on an asset of real value.

541
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.489
In one case, Praed and company of Truro,

542
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.969
country bankers came to specialize in Watt steam engines

543
00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:34.130
pumping out Cornish tin and copper mines --

544
00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:39.130
an early example of effective equipment financing with relationships,

545
00:37:39.131 --> 00:37:41.250
with both the mines and Boulton and Watt.

546
00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:46.890
Finally country banks provided executor and trustee services when

547
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:52.410
a proprietor died, facilitating the continuance of the business after his death.

548
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.530
Knocking out the fly by night operations,

549
00:37:56.250 --> 00:38:00.969
there were by 1780 a couple of hundred solid country banks all run

550
00:38:00.989 --> 00:38:03.250
independently by different partner groups.

551
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.610
Since there was no centralized credit training,

552
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.370
each country bank did business in its own way with its own specialties.

553
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:16.850
Providing an entrepreneur was not so eccentric as to setup his business where

554
00:38:16.851 --> 00:38:18.370
there was no local expertise,

555
00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:23.210
there were probably half a dozen country banks he could talk to within a day's

556
00:38:23.211 --> 00:38:26.370
horse ride, each of them doing business differently.

557
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.650
Even as a working man,

558
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.450
he could probably get an introduction to one of them or more if he needed it.

559
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.760
These people were regarded as superior tradesman,

560
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.280
not socially grand like the later London merchant bankers.

561
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:40.961
As one example,

562
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:45.760
Richard Arkwright with limited education and a background as a hairdresser

563
00:38:45.761 --> 00:38:46.594
and wigmaker,

564
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.080
got considerable financial help from Wright and Co of Nottingham,

565
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.239
a country bank founded in 1761.

566
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.480
The result was that in the country banking system,

567
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:03.440
many entrepreneurs obtained finance and a vast range of small businesses

568
00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:07.120
were able to discount their receivables, which is what most of them needed.

569
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:12.560
No group think was possible, no fashionable ideas quelled the eccentric,

570
00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.760
the bankers were not fashionable.

571
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.520
If an idea could work and could be begun on a modest scale,

572
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.560
the chances were that it could be financed.

573
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:27.160
The localism and pluralism of England's country banking system made it a

574
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:29.520
major contributor to the Industrial Revolution,

575
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.040
which has not been sufficiently recognized.

576
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:37.440
If banking had still been concentrated in London as before 1760,

577
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.600
it's most unlikely that the many small scale early industrialists in the

578
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.600
provinces could have obtained finance.

579
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:51.950
The 1760s also saw the emergence of five important industrialists

580
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:56.469
whose careers, immensely assisted by the canals and country banks,

581
00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.750
launched Britain fully into industrialization in all its facets.

582
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.830
They were: Josiah Wedgwood.

583
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.870
The potter in business from 1759 who invented modern marketing

584
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.630
techniques and for whom the Trent and Mersey canal was essential.

585
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.710
His Etruria Works was built beside it's route.

586
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.190
John Roebuck,

587
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:24.469
founder of the Carron Iron Works in 1759 and he owned

588
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.340
a colliery;

589
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.950
patron of James Watt in the 1760s to attempt to pump out the colliery.

590
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.950
Carron was a prime instigator of the Forth and Clyde Canal.

591
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.310
John Wilkinson.

592
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:42.110
Ironmaster from 1757 and inventor of the boring machine for

593
00:40:42.111 --> 00:40:44.670
steam engine cylinders in 1774.

594
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.670
Early investor in the Staffordshire and Worcestershire canal;

595
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:54.350
later founded several country banks and issued his own copper coinage.

596
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:01.030
Richard Arkwright, patented his spinning frame in 1769.

597
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.110
His early efforts funded by Wright and Company.

598
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:09.630
He was the main financier of the 14 and a half mile Cromford canal to

599
00:41:09.631 --> 00:41:13.230
serve his Cromford mill. His son founded a country bank.

600
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.550
Matthew Bolton substantial Birmingham manufacturer from

601
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:22.110
1757, sponsor of the Birmingham canal,

602
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.030
which had a branch to his Soho Manufactory.

603
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:30.230
Later partnered with James Watt whose steam engines required cheap coal supplied

604
00:41:30.231 --> 00:41:32.830
by the canals. Overall,

605
00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.760
the sudden appearance of these industrial entrepreneurs indicates that Walter

606
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:43.040
Rostow's takeoff of the Industrial Revolution occurred not in the 1780s

607
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.960
as Rostow postulated, but nearly two decades earlier,

608
00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:51.960
largely sparked by the first canal boom and the country banks emergence.

609
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:57.000
Whether the political transition of 1760 directly catalyzed

610
00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.840
industrialization can be questioned. More likely,

611
00:42:00.969 --> 00:42:03.800
it had been latent for half a century before this,

612
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.640
had begun to appear in Queen Anne's time,

613
00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:11.239
but had been dampened by the takeover of the authoritarian and London

614
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.480
centered Whigs in 1714.

615
00:42:14.219 --> 00:42:18.480
But there's no question the pluralistic Tory emergence assisted it.

616
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.760
And key Tories like Gower and Newdigate rolled up their sleeves and got

617
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:24.953
directly involved.

618
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.800
There are two lessons for today to be learned from this podcast. First,

619
00:42:31.219 --> 00:42:36.040
infrastructure like Brindley's canals can be crucial to economic growth,

620
00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:41.239
but only if it revolutionizes existing economic patterns as Brindley's

621
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.120
canals did increasing heavy goods transportation capacity 25

622
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.790
fold.

623
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:52.080
Spending a hundred billion pounds on a train that saves 20 minutes between

624
00:42:52.081 --> 00:42:54.960
London and Manchester is a complete waste of money.

625
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.120
Building a bridge between Galloway and Ulster,

626
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:02.320
connecting two parts of the same country that have never been connected before,

627
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.880
may on the other hand, well be worthwhile.

628
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:10.370
The second lesson is that innovation comes from small units,

629
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:14.730
not large ones and needs a financial system geared to this reality.

630
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.650
A financial system of beheamoth banks with a hundred thousand employees is

631
00:43:20.651 --> 00:43:23.650
a nominally private sector version of the old Soviet Gosplan.

632
00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.770
It will never finance anything new and useful.

633
00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.969
Nor will a system of hedge funds and private equity funds where they all follow

634
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.650
the same fashionable and probably incorrect nostrums.

635
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.330
We need a truly diverse financial system where the decision makers are not

636
00:43:40.331 --> 00:43:45.250
fashionable, but are local and are available for any ordinary person to contact.

637
00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.330
In today's world, that's a tough ask.

638
00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.090
It's perhaps the toughest to recover of all the Industrial Revolution's

639
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:57.050
preconditions of growth, but it is worth making the attempt.

640
00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.733
Finally,

641
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:04.170
I hope this podcast has convinced you that the emergence of the Industrial

642
00:44:04.171 --> 00:44:08.010
Revolution in Britain was indeed a Tory Story.

643
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.370
Thank you very much for listening.

644
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.130
That is the end of Tory Stories podcast number three.
