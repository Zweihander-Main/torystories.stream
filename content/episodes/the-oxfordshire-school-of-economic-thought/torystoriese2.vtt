<v 1>These Tory Stories</v>

2
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:11.640
podcasts aim to act as modest counters to the almost

3
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.670
universal Whig version of history.

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.290
Observing history in the world from the point of view of an 18th century Tory.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.330
Their particular focus will be on the industrial revolution

6
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.190
and the Tory achievements of 1660-1832.

7
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.820
Tory Story 2:

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.210
The Oxfordshire School of Economic thought.

9
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.420
Lord Liverpool's economic policies applied at the crucial point of the

10
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:46.620
industrial revolution's economic takeoff were remarkably

11
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:51.570
successful producing a century of unprecedented economic growth.

12
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
This podcast will trace the development of the school of economic thought

13
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.740
predominantly growing within the 17th and 18th century Tory party

14
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.110
that animated those policies.

15
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.990
It will show that the rural county of Oxfordshire, not the university,

16
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.150
produced that school, which I've therefore christened the Oxfordshire school.

17
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.520
The Oxfordshire school's principles were quite distinct from the Whigish

18
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.560
view of Adam Smith and William Gladstone that became known as classical

19
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:26.430
economics,

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.920
Though they share some elements with both that and the later Austrian school.

21
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.720
Furthermore,

22
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
many of the Oxfordshire school's principles were developed well before the

23
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:42.750
publication of the Wealth of Nations. In summary,

24
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.910
the most successful economic policies in world history in terms of their

25
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.280
long-term global effects can be traced back in their origins to

26
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:58.110
before the English civil war and the idyllic Oxfordshire village

27
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.550
of Great Tew.

28
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.490
First a brief primer on Liverpool's economic policies.

29
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.140
Overall, they were an amalgam of classical and Austrian economics albeit

30
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:15.210
adopted in many cases before either of those theories were promulgated.

31
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.180
Property rights were sacrosanct; The most important economic principle.

32
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.610
Free trade is good,

33
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.770
but revenues from tariffs and excises are even better since they

34
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:30.780
fall primarily on the well-off.

35
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.780
Corn laws work:

36
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.370
they assure food security in wartime and protect

37
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.870
agricultural workers from impoverishment

38
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.200
thereby raising wages all round and encouraging the use of

39
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:47.070
technology.

40
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.380
Free trade does not work in extreme circumstances,

41
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.580
such as the British famine of 1800 when Jenkinson and

42
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.910
Liverpool combined to allow state bread production from imported

43
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.200
grain over the protests of free trade purists.

44
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.710
Bubbles inevitably occur because of foolish investment derived from

45
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.300
excess money creation.

46
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.740
They should be deflated if possible and should not lead to

47
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.700
bailouts. Here, Liverpool anticipated the Austrians.

48
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.670
The banking system should be local and atomized and riskless

49
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:32.380
savings vehicles should be separated from risk-taking bank lending.

50
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.670
Overall rentiers should be encouraged,

51
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.640
not euthanized as Keynes wanted to do.

52
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.520
Paper money should be issued only by privately owned banks,

53
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.830
not by the government or a state controlled central bank and should be anchored

54
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.630
by a firm gold standard.

55
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.050
Modest cash payments or food handouts for poor relief are

56
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:04.450
economically beneficial because they reduce the downside risks of

57
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.230
working class enterprise. Anything beyond this,

58
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:09.730
for example,

59
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:14.500
a 19th century workhouse system set up by the 1834

60
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:19.180
poor law amendment act is expensive and almost

61
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:21.460
certainly cruel and damaging.

62
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.560
To see where these economic policies come from,

63
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.570
we need to visit first the idyllic Oxfordshire village of

64
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.620
great Tew in the decade of the 1630s,

65
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.780
before the disputes between king Charles the first and his parliaments descended

66
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:44.050
into civil war. In that decade,

67
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:48.250
the Manor house at great Tew was occupied by Lucius

68
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.430
Carey, Second Viscount Falkland,

69
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.830
a wealthy aristocrat who inherited large Oxfordshire estates on the

70
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.530
death of his father in 1633.

71
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.250
Falkland was a remarkable man. Edward Hyde later, Earl of Clarendon wrote

72
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.890
later that all mankind could not, but admire and love him.

73
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.410
At great Tew,

74
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.910
he assembled a circle of theological and political thinkers, which Hyde,

75
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:20.470
one of their number,

76
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.550
described as "a college situate in a purer air".

77
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.670
Apart from Falkland and Hyde, the group included John Selden,

78
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.390
foremost legal thinker of his time, Gilbert Sheldon,

79
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.070
who became Archbishop of Canterbury after the restoration,

80
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.980
the poets Abraham Cowley,

81
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.110
Sir John Suckling and Thomas Carew and Edmund Waller,

82
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.060
a poet and politically moderate politician who served in parliament

83
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:56.050
intermittently for 60 years from 1625 to

84
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:57.380
1685.

85
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.100
The great Tew circle following the doctrines of Richard Hooker,

86
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.530
the Elizabethan theologian,

87
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:11.360
propounded a rationalist approach to religion and

88
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:15.470
opposed the somewhat intolerant and very corrupt government of Charles the

89
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:18.170
first, although they remained royalist.

90
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.190
They differed from time to time on religion and other matters,

91
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.930
but consciously took the view of Cicero and Erasmus that such

92
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.580
differences should not mar an underlying friendship and might lead to

93
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:32.414
truth.

94
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.860
Economics was peripheral to the great Tew group,

95
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.110
but they strongly opposed the Royal monopolies that hampered the economy under

96
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:46.190
the early Stuarts, supporting freedom of domestic trade.

97
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.220
An example of the kind of monopoly great Tew objected to

98
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.630
was the new soap monopoly of 1632.

99
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.210
A group of well-connected courtiers of Charles the first had invented a

100
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:05.390
new kind of soap, which they claimed washeth whiter.

101
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.310
Instead of just marketing their product in the normal way,

102
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.320
they persuaded Charles the first to grant them a monopoly over all soaps sold

103
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:19.970
throughout the kingdom, so that only their new soap could be used.

104
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.550
Other soap makers were shut down.

105
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.100
The result was that the general populous refused to buy the expensive new

106
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:32.360
soap, thus becoming not only disgruntled, but filthy.

107
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.000
This sorry episode was a major source of parliamentary support

108
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:40.310
in the crisis leading up to the civil war.

109
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.210
Great Tew's thinkers objected to the state imposed restrictions of the

110
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.940
Tudor and early Stuart monarchy,

111
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.140
so they had an early belief in the value of freeing up trade,

112
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.970
at least domestically, and removing restrictions on property transfer.

113
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.700
Clarendon would develop these ideas during his time as Lord Chancellor and

114
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:08.720
effective prime minister in 1660 to 67.

115
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.200
When crisis came in 1640

116
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.590
Falkland whose Viscountcy was Scottish thus not carrying a seat in the

117
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:20.930
Lords, and Edward Hyde,

118
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:25.790
the future Clarendon formed an important moderate group in the

119
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:28.070
long Parliament's house of commons.

120
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.060
They began by supporting major reforms,

121
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.950
but ended up opposing John Pym's Grand Remonstrance of

122
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:38.780
November, 1641.

123
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.450
The Grand Remonstrance passed by only 11 votes and by destroying the

124
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:48.920
central principles of Charles' government made rapprochement with the crown

125
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:52.790
impossible. According to Clarendon's later history,

126
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.210
Oliver Cromwell had planned to emigrate to New England if it failed;

127
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.140
and there's an interesting alternate history novel in that thought.

128
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.230
Falkland and Hyde then joined Charles the first's administration.

129
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.250
Falkland as secretary of state, Hyde as chancellor of the Exchequer.

130
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.880
When the nation descended into civil war,

131
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:17.820
Falkland fought for the king at the battle of Edgehill,

132
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:22.470
but became discouraged by the royalist lack of success and

133
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.110
the worsening relations between the two sides.

134
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:29.310
Thus before the second battle of Newbury in September

135
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:30.744
1643,

136
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.840
Falkland told his friends that he forsaw much misery to

137
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:40.800
his own country and did believe he should be out of it ere night,

138
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:44.400
after which he was killed in that day's battle.

139
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:47.010
His influence lived on, however,

140
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:51.960
both as a romantic example of the perfect cavalier gentleman

141
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.330
and as an intellectual mentor to Hyde,

142
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.050
the future Clarendon who,

143
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:02.400
although two years older was less rich and from a less elevated gentry

144
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:06.630
background, so saw Falkland as his mentor as well as his friend.

145
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.840
As a romantic hero, Falkland was much admired by the Victorians.

146
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:18.270
Sir John Marriott in his 1907 biography described him

147
00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:21.330
as combining in no ordinary degree,

148
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:26.250
the intellectual luxuriance of the Greek and the moral austerity of

149
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.540
the Puritan. His principle importance to later generations however,

150
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.630
was the intellectual impetus,

151
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:36.840
which he and the great Tew circle gave to his friend Hyde. Clarendon

152
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.240
(Hyde) was also an Oxfordshire man. His seat was at Cornbury,

153
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.040
eight miles from great Tew.

154
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.240
As Lord chancellor from 1660 to 67,

155
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.340
he set up the restoration constitutional settlement and pushed Britain

156
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.860
in an entirely new direction economically towards an industrial

157
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.263
revolution in the future.

158
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.100
Later through his second son Lawrence Hyde Earl of Rochester,

159
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.050
he was the inspiration for the Tory part of 1678 onwards.

160
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.180
Finally, his history of the great rebellion published after his death,

161
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.080
is generally regarded as the greatest work of history written in the 17th

162
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:22.914
century.

163
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:30.000
Clarendon's new economic ideas appeared immediately after the

164
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:34.740
restoration with the convention Parliament's passage of the tenures

165
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.900
abolition act 1660.

166
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.690
This eliminated many feudal dues and service obligations that have

167
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:46.170
been due to the crown. More important,

168
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.180
it eliminated the feudal restrictions on landholding making land an asset

169
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:54.820
that could be freely bought, sold, and mortgaged.

170
00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.100
By this means it freed up enormous amounts of capital that could be used to

171
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:04.990
finance industrialization. In creating a free market in land,

172
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.590
this act gave Britain an advantage that France,

173
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.750
Spain and the holy Roman empire all lacked even a century later.

174
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.210
To replace state revenues from eliminated feudal dues,

175
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.370
section 14 of the Tenures abolition act also imposed an

176
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.080
excise duty on tea, coffee, sherbet, and chocolate.

177
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.160
By shifting state revenues to these new sources,

178
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.570
Clarendon performed a vital service for the country's fiscal future.

179
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.240
Most previous taxes had been fixed in amount so vulnerable

180
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:47.470
to inflation and failing to increase as the country's population and prosperity

181
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:50.530
grew. On the other hand,

182
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:55.000
customs and excise duties on these newly consumed products,

183
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.220
as well as on tobacco and sugar produced in Britain's American and west Indian

184
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:05.170
colonies increased with the increase in national wealth, trade,

185
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.490
luxury, and consumption of these expensive imported goods.

186
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.460
These new revenues form the basis of Britain's taxation system until the

187
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:18.820
1840s. By 1792,

188
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.470
customs and excise duties were producing 69% of Britain's

189
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:26.980
revenue of 18.7 million pounds,

190
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.380
itself some 15 times the revenue in 1661 in pounds

191
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:33.214
whose value had changed little.

192
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.540
The burden of this new system fell primarily on the luxury consuming

193
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:41.740
wealthier classes.

194
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.930
The revenues it produced were naturally buoyant as wealth and trade increased.

195
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.980
Clarendon also reformed the coinage producing the first milled coinage whose

196
00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:55.660
edges were machine stamped,

197
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.440
reducing the ability to debase the coinage through clipping.

198
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.020
He reformed administration,

199
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.090
removing internal duties and stamping up the monopolies that had persisted in

200
00:14:07.091 --> 00:14:08.260
Charles the first's time,

201
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.460
despite the 1624 statute of monopolies.

202
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.560
This made internal trade flow smoothly unlike in France,

203
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.700
the holy Roman empire and other countries where internal duties persisted.

204
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.023
Clarendon's

205
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:29.590
reforms were those of a practical statesman with little backing

206
00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:34.510
of economic theory. He was aware of Thomas Mun's mercantilist theories,

207
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.740
but adhered to them only to the extent they improved state revenues,

208
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:39.850
his principle aim.

209
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.670
Economic theory followed in the writings of the merchant and statesman,

210
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:46.504
Sir Dudley North.

211
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.040
North was another Oxfordshire man being MP for Bambury

212
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.880
close to the North family seat at Wroxton Abbey. North

213
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:02.360
was the youngest son of fourth baron North and made a modest fortune

214
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:05.000
as a merchant in Turkey,

215
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.440
becoming the Levant company's chief representative there.

216
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.900
He thus had a detailed hands-on idea of how

217
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:19.700
international trade worked.

218
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:25.340
He returned to London in 1680 and resumed a mercantile business

219
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.300
where he had a sharp eye for foolish speculations.

220
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.630
As his brother Roger said in his biography,

221
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.520
I have often heard Sir Dudley say run away from great

222
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.390
bargains,

223
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.220
so I doubt he would have made but an indifferent south sea merchant.

224
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.070
Referring to the south sea bubble of course.

225
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.920
North was nominated sheriff of the city of London in 1682,

226
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.230
where he was initially beaten by the Whig candidate, but installed by the king.

227
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:02.750
In office North presided over the juries that condemned the Whig martyrs,

228
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.210
William Russell and Algernon Sydney to execution for their involvement in the

229
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:11.930
rye house plot to assassinate Charles the second.

230
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.400
He was then through the influence of Clarendon's son Rochester,

231
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.830
who was at that time Lord treasurer,

232
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:24.440
made commissioner of customs where his skill with accounts enabled

233
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:29.090
him first to eliminate several frauds in the customs and then at the

234
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:33.830
request of Rochester to prove that the books for the farm

235
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.520
of the half tax revenues were also fraudulent.

236
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.020
After the accession of James the second,

237
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.250
North was elected chairman of the ways and means committee in the

238
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:48.380
1685 parliament. Here,

239
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.540
he rejected the land tax proposed by the Whigs and

240
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:57.560
instead imposed modest customs duties on tobacco and sugar,

241
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.090
both colonial commodities whose consumption was rapidly increasing.

242
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.371
However,

243
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:09.230
he failed to prevent an excessively lucrative arrangement by which

244
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:14.150
the Goldsmiths could bring bullion into the treasury and have it coined into

245
00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:18.950
money by weight, which at times of low bullion prices was inflationary.

246
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.960
In a meeting with parliamentarians and Lord treasurer Rochester,

247
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.340
Sir Dudley North reasoned with them against it beyond

248
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:31.550
reply. And then the argument was let there be money my lord

249
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.780
by God, let there be money.

250
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.850
The country gentlemen are commonly full of one profound mistake,

251
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.600
which is that if a great deal of money be made,

252
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.550
they must have a share of it,

253
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.180
such be the supposed consequence of what they call plenty of money.

254
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.940
Some things don't change.

255
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.070
The country gentlemen of 1685 succumbed to the Keynesian money

256
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:00.840
printing fallacies of today.

257
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.020
North's main contribution, however, was,

258
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:11.040
his 1691 pamphlet discourses upon trade,

259
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.840
the earliest classic of free market economics 40 years before

260
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:19.560
Cantillon and 85 years before the wealth of nations.

261
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.950
This had limited circulation at the time,

262
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.260
but North's friendships with influential Tories and his own public

263
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:31.950
career gave it considerable policy significance.

264
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.080
It was rediscovered by the economist, John McCulloch,

265
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.440
who not only republished it in 1822,

266
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.770
but sent a copy to David Ricardo who responded I had no

267
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:51.750
idea that anyone entertained such correct opinions as are expressed in

268
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:54.450
this publication at so early a period.

269
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.290
North believed that interest rates and trade should both be as free as possible

270
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.440
and summarized England's economy of 1691 as follows:

271
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:13.260
in process of time if the people apply themselves industriously

272
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.860
they will not only be supplied,

273
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.250
but advance to a great overplus of foreign goods,

274
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.050
which improved would enlarge their trade. Thus,

275
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:29.450
the English nation will sell onto the French, Spanish, Turk,

276
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.170
et cetera, not only the product of their own country as cloth,

277
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.480
tin, led, et cetera, but also what they purchase of others as sugar,

278
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:41.580
pepper, calicos, et cetera.

279
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.950
Still buying where goods are produced and cheap and transporting them to

280
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:51.270
places where they are wanted making great advantage thereby.

281
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.720
North also anticipated Mandeville's 1714 fable of

282
00:19:57.721 --> 00:19:58.590
the bees.

283
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.630
The main spur to trade or rather to industry and

284
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:07.620
ingenuity is the exorbitant appetites of men,

285
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.870
which they will take pains to gratify and so be disposed to

286
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:16.410
work when nothing else will incline them to it.

287
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.760
For did men content themselves with bare necessities,

288
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.010
we should have a poor world.

289
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.890
North ends by condemning sumptuary laws,

290
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.940
restrictions on trade and other government interference.

291
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.720
Thus, we may labor to hedge in the Cuckoo,

292
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:41.040
but in vain for no people ever yet grew rich by

293
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:44.340
policies, but it is peace, industry,

294
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.460
and freedom that brings trade and wealth and nothing else.

295
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.050
I couldn't have put it better myself. The phrase,

296
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:57.610
no people ever yet grew rich by policies should be forced

297
00:20:57.611 --> 00:21:02.350
recitation for every Keynesian or Marxist economist and indeed

298
00:21:02.351 --> 00:21:05.380
every politician until they understand it.

299
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.400
North's great Grandnephew Frederick Lord North was

300
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:17.170
prime minister from 1770 to 1782 and chancellor of the

301
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:19.420
Exchequer for three years before that.

302
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.140
He was a noted expert in economic matters,

303
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.860
remaining chancellor of the Exchequer throughout his administration.

304
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.360
While reading and patronizing Adam Smith,

305
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:36.640
he brought Sir Dudley North's economic ideas into his administration's policies

306
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.330
and would have gone further had it not been for the American war.

307
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.450
North gets blamed for the loss of the American colonies.

308
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.110
But while you cannot give him more than a small share of the credit,

309
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.240
the crucial takeoff phase of the industrial revolution happened mostly

310
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:58.420
during his 15 years in charge of economic policy.

311
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.460
The duke of Grafton,

312
00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:05.380
his boss was prime minister from 1767 to 70 was more

313
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:09.520
interested in horseracing. Well, what do I mean by that?

314
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.440
Didn't the industrial revolution happen during the 1780s under the Younger Pitt?

315
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.480
Well, no, it didn't. James Watts' rotary steam engine,

316
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.190
the first steam engine that could power machinery was introduced in

317
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:27.400
1783. And of course it changed the world.

318
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.810
But the industrial revolution was about a lot more than one improved model of

319
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:35.080
steam engine, and in any case, Watt's condenser,

320
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.160
his other great advance had been invented in 1769.

321
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.590
The 1760s and early 1770s saw four major

322
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:49.150
changes that together caused economic liftoff. They were:

323
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.850
a sudden doubling in the annual number of patent applications between the

324
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:57.370
1750s and the 1760s,

325
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:03.850
an explosion in the number of local country banks that for the first

326
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:08.830
time gave ordinary people the ability to finance small local businesses,

327
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.400
an outburst of great industrialists that between them caused the economy to

328
00:23:15.401 --> 00:23:19.600
surge: Josiah Wedgwood, John Roebuck,

329
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.800
John 'iron mad' Wilkinson, Richard Arkwright,

330
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.350
and Matthew Boulton all made their first and most important advances in the

331
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:33.280
1760s. And finally,

332
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:35.740
the first great wave of canal building.

333
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.870
The Bridgewater canal completed in 1761 had shown the

334
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:41.704
way,

335
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:46.370
but the canal's getting parliamentary approval from 1766 to

336
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:50.270
1770, all designed by James Brindley,

337
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:55.610
and mostly forming part of his grand cross scheme to link the Trent,

338
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.380
Mersey, Severn,

339
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.240
and Thames rivers revolutionized Britain's transportation system.

340
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.910
They made it possible for the first time to move bulky goods long

341
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:11.180
distances and thus created a true national market.

342
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:17.060
The difference is that a horse and cart could move about one and a half tons

343
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:21.530
of goods whereas a canal barge could move 50

344
00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:24.650
tons. It was that great a qualitative difference.

345
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:30.980
The American war slowed development down as wars generally do because

346
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:34.970
they make private sector finance more expensive and difficult to obtain.

347
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.890
But the industrial revolution was already in full swing before that was started.

348
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.680
The first serious outbreak of machine breaking factory burning Luddism

349
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.600
occurred in 1779. Those machine burners,

350
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.950
the worst outbreak of which occurred at Richard Arkwright's Birkacre

351
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:59.300
factory in Lancashire were protesting against the effect that

352
00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:03.740
industrialization's greater efficiencies appeared to have on job

353
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.080
opportunities. In reality,

354
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:09.440
the textile industry was in a downswing because of the war.

355
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.390
In summary North may have lost the American colonies,

356
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.310
but he helped to give Britain something much more valuable: Industrialization.

357
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:26.510
Probably North's most important purely economic legislation was the corn

358
00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:28.430
act 1773.

359
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.070
The steady rise in British population from around 1740

360
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.930
had now almost eliminated the grain export surplus of the 1740s

361
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.080
so that the trade was approximately in balance,

362
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.780
but fluctuating sharply from year to year.

363
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.120
Elizabethan laws had forbidden grain speculation

364
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.940
preventing the market from working properly.

365
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.160
So North decided to eliminate those laws and move to a freely

366
00:25:58.161 --> 00:26:00.770
traded system. However,

367
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:05.780
exports would be forbidden and imports freely allowed when the

368
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:08.540
corn price was above 48 shillings per quarter;

369
00:26:08.541 --> 00:26:13.430
that was roughly equivalent to the paper money 80 shillings

370
00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:16.340
per quarter of Liverpool's 1815 law,

371
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.970
and the reverse when the price was below that level.

372
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:25.280
While this would make grain on average, more expensive for British consumers,

373
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.350
eliminating the cheap grain bonanza of the 1730s and forties,

374
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.270
it would support agricultural incomes and through labor market

375
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:39.080
competition raise nominal incomes outside agriculture.

376
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.310
As the economist Thomas Malthus was to point to Liverpool in

377
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:48.000
1813-14, this had two advantages.

378
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.170
First with imports prevented when grain prices were low,

379
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.540
the country would be more self-sufficient in time of war since the

380
00:26:57.541 --> 00:27:02.430
maximum possible amount of land would be kept in cultivation. Second,

381
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.050
the corn laws effect of forcing up wages would ensure that British

382
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:11.490
labor was relatively high in cost compared to that of foreign

383
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:16.290
countries and that would encourage the substitution of labor by

384
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:17.124
machinery.

385
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.860
This latter effect was a major contributor to Britain's industrial advancement.

386
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:28.140
It's generally agreed among all economists that Britain's high cost of labor

387
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:33.360
was an important advantage making substitution of machinery for

388
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:37.320
labor more immediately profitable than in other countries,

389
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.350
the early steam engines were very inefficient

390
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.660
so you had to have a large advantage for steam to make them substituted for

391
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:46.494
labor.

392
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.170
An additional second order effect of higher grain prices was to raise the price

393
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:53.004
of land,

394
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.840
making it easier for proprietors to mortgage their land as had the duke of

395
00:27:57.841 --> 00:28:00.000
Bridgewater to pay for his canal.

396
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.910
The low land prices of the 1740s discouraged such ventures and

397
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:07.350
other industrial investment.

398
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.680
North's corn laws and Liverpool's own corn laws of 1815 were a

399
00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:16.620
product of their Oxford school economic thinking.

400
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.410
They were not simple free traders,

401
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:24.270
and certainly did not favor ultra low labor costs of many

402
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:28.920
disciples of Adam Smith were to do, particularly in the 19th century.

403
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.520
The following year vitally important legislation for a relatively new

404
00:28:35.521 --> 00:28:40.200
industry was the life assurance act of 1774.

405
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:45.720
This for the first time introduced the concept of an insurable interest so that

406
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:50.310
it became illegal to take out life assurance on a third party without a

407
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:53.340
legitimate economic interest in that person's life.

408
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.480
While a maximum sum assured would be the amount of that interest.

409
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:03.090
This stopped all the gambling and third-party assassinations that had

410
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:07.260
taken place with the tontines and annuities of the 1690s

411
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.060
making life assurance a respectable investment

412
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.610
for the middle classes thereby greatly widening its scope.

413
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.740
After North fell, his ideas did not die.

414
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.970
They were carried on by his colleague and friend Charles Jenkinson,

415
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.520
who became president of the board of trade in 1786 and as first Earl

416
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:32.550
of Liverpool, the father and mentor of the prime minister.

417
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.510
The Jenkinson's were also an Oxfordshire family.

418
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.380
Charles was brought up at Shipton-under-Wychwood about four miles from his

419
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:44.290
Jenkinson Baronet cousin's family seat at Walcot,

420
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:50.200
which itself was close to Cornbury (Clarendon's place) and thus

421
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:51.370
eight miles from great Tew.

422
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:57.790
The Jenkinson Baronet's ran out of money and sold Walcot in 1758,

423
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:02.980
which is why Charles Jenkinson took the initial title of Lord Hawkesbury

424
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.830
after the family's other estates in Gloucestershire.

425
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.310
Jenkinson entered top politics as Bute's private secretary in

426
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:16.990
1761 then became one of two secretaries to the treasury under

427
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:17.824
Grenville,

428
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.660
where he played a major role in designing the stamp act before losing office

429
00:30:22.661 --> 00:30:27.190
with Grenville. He had however, now being befriended by George the third,

430
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:32.350
so played an increasingly important backroom role even when not officially in

431
00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:36.790
office. As a Lord of the treasury in the late 1760s,

432
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.320
Jenkinson befriended North then was an increasingly vital

433
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:46.210
communications link between the king and North throughout North's period in

434
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:50.710
office becoming secretary at war in 1778.

435
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.080
After North fell,

436
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.920
Jenkinson played an important role in the maneuvering of

437
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:58.540
December,

438
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.740
1783 that brought Pitt to power then became president of the board of trade in

439
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:04.000
1786,

440
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.620
where he remained until 1804 cooperating with

441
00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:12.370
Matthew Boulton on a notable coinage scheme,

442
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.190
which produced in 1797,

443
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.360
the machine stamped cartwheel, penny and tuppenny pieces.

444
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:27.460
Jenkinson played a substantial role in economic policy under Greenville then did

445
00:31:27.461 --> 00:31:32.440
so again after 1767 as a major advisor to the king and

446
00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:33.274
North.

447
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.200
Out of office in 1782-84 and initially resisted by Pitt,

448
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.670
he was an even more important economic policy maker from

449
00:31:42.671 --> 00:31:47.170
1786 on pulling Pitt's government in the direction of

450
00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:51.760
Toryism to which he was firmly attached after 1787 or

451
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:52.780
so,

452
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.460
and providing a skeptical grownup in the room voice to Pitt and his

453
00:31:57.461 --> 00:32:02.200
other young Adam Smith acolytes all 30 years younger than

454
00:32:02.201 --> 00:32:03.034
Jenkinson.

455
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.100
Jenkinson and North both derived their economic policies from the Oxfordshire

456
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:10.720
school of economic theory.

457
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:15.640
They were influenced by Adam Smith who published the wealth of nations in

458
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:17.080
1776.

459
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.150
But unlike Pitt were not wholehearted acolytes of Smith's free trade

460
00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:24.820
theories, believing for example,

461
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:29.770
that customs duties had an important role to play in financing British

462
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.633
governments.

463
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.640
Jenkinson's economic outlook can be seen from a letter to a cabinet colleague

464
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.950
during the severe food dearth of 1800,

465
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.020
the most difficult of the war. In times of distress,

466
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.883
he remarked,

467
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:50.510
the seller becomes master of the market and it then becomes

468
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:53.510
absurd to rest one's confidence in Adam Smith,

469
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.520
who has pushed his principles to an extravagant length and in some

470
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:00.200
respects has erred.

471
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:06.230
Jenkinson thus favored government efforts to alleviate famine and handouts

472
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:10.370
to the poor suffering under it. Not for him, the free trading Whigs,

473
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:14.810
passive response to the Irish potato famine of the 1840s.

474
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.720
The economic traditions of the Oxfordshire school then descended to

475
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.980
Jenkinson's son, Robert Banks Jenkinson second Earl of Liverpool,

476
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:30.170
who in due course applied them to economic policy from around 1807

477
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:32.480
onwards as he became first,

478
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:37.370
the most experienced economic policy maker among the senior Tory's and then

479
00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:38.240
prime minister.

480
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.310
He was in many ways the most successful economic policy maker Britain's ever

481
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:46.430
had, but that story is discussed elsewhere.

482
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:51.920
But the ideas he used were derived from his eminent father who had 40

483
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:56.630
years experience in top economic policymaking. Through him,

484
00:33:56.631 --> 00:34:00.920
the ideas can be traced back through the North's and Clarendon,

485
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:05.540
all of them Oxfordshire men to the nonpareil of chivalry and political

486
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:10.430
creativity who died on Newbury field in 1643.

487
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.300
The ideas deserved to be better remembered,

488
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.300
but so do the people who created and used them.

489
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.960
The Oxfordshire school of economic thought,

490
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.450
it gave the world the industrial revolution and it would serve us well

491
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:30.560
today. Thank you very much for listening.

492
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.790
That is the end of Tory Stories podcast number 2.
