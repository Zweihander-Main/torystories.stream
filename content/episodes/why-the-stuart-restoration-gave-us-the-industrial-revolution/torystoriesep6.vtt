00:04.970 --> 00:09.228
These Tory Stories podcasts aim to act as

2
00:09.252 --> 00:11.560
counters to the universal Whig version of

3
00:11.584 --> 00:14.651
history, observing history and the world

4
00:14.764 --> 00:17.605
from the viewpoint of an 18th Century Tory.

5
00:17.629 --> 00:20.144
Their focus will be on the Industrial

6
00:20.168 --> 00:22.851
Revolution and the Tory achievements of

7
00:22.875 --> 00:25.351
1660-1832.

8
00:26.629 --> 00:31.223
Tory Story VI – Why the Stuart Restoration

9
00:31.247 --> 00:33.504
Gave Us the Industrial Revolution

10
00:34.701 --> 00:35.991
Britain's Industrial

11
00:36.015 --> 00:38.562
Revolution, lifting the living standards

12
00:38.586 --> 00:40.780
and transformed the lives of everybody

13
00:40.804 --> 00:44.417
today, and as I have discussed that process

14
00:44.441 --> 00:47.772
began in the late 1760s, in the early years

15
00:47.796 --> 00:49.553
of George III.

16
00:49.577 --> 00:52.801
By that stage, however, it was clear to

17
00:52.825 --> 00:54.958
everybody that Britain’s society and

18
00:54.982 --> 00:57.255
economy were different from all other

19
00:57.279 --> 00:59.971
countries and that revolutionary change

20
00:59.995 --> 01:02.178
might well happen there.

21
01:02.202 --> 01:04.520
Today I am going to look at the process of

22
01:04.544 --> 01:06.914
making Britain different from other West

23
01:06.938 --> 01:09.794
European countries, which mostly happened

24
01:09.818 --> 01:11.859
about a century earlier, with the

25
01:11.883 --> 01:15.554
Restoration of 1660 and the succeeding

26
01:15.578 --> 01:18.060
years until the 1688 Revolution.

27
01:18.084 --> 01:22.242
I want to discuss in this podcast what made

28
01:22.266 --> 01:25.676
the Restoration period so special and what

29
01:25.700 --> 01:28.743
changes made Britain’s path deviate from

30
01:28.767 --> 01:31.197
that of other countries.

31
01:31.221 --> 01:33.505
Three things had already begun to

32
01:33.699 --> 01:34.739
differentiate Britain

33
01:34.763 --> 01:37.566
before the English Civil War broke out in

34
01:37.590 --> 01:42.275
1642: Francis Bacon’s Scientific Method,

35
01:42.299 --> 01:45.833
the beginnings in the Great Tew circle of

36
01:45.857 --> 01:49.013
what later became Toryism and the immense

37
01:49.037 --> 01:52.057
movement of peoples across the Atlantic, to

38
01:52.081 --> 01:54.338
colonize the American mainland and the West

39
01:54.362 --> 01:56.328
Indies.

40
01:56.352 --> 01:59.459
The Scientific Method was propounded by

41
01:59.483 --> 02:04.222
Bacon in his 1620 Novum Organum

42
02:04.246 --> 02:07.679
Scientiarum, although other thinkers in

43
02:07.703 --> 02:10.141
several countries had got close to it.

44
02:10.165 --> 02:13.326
It showed practical technologists how they

45
02:13.350 --> 02:15.459
could perfect their machines using an

46
02:15.483 --> 02:17.320
iterative method of practical

47
02:17.344 --> 02:20.382
experimentation refined by theoretical

48
02:20.406 --> 02:22.894
reasoning, leading to further practical

49
02:22.918 --> 02:26.752
experimentation. This powerful methodology

50
02:26.776 --> 02:30.785
produced more sustained advances than had

51
02:30.809 --> 02:34.193
previously been possible and provided an

52
02:34.217 --> 02:37.100
intellectual paradigm that would prove key

53
02:37.124 --> 02:39.329
to the Industrial Revolution.

54
02:39.353 --> 02:42.209
Western European countries other than

55
02:42.233 --> 02:45.112
Britain had equal access to Bacon’s

56
02:45.136 --> 02:48.060
treatise (which was written in Latin and

57
02:48.084 --> 02:50.012
published in the Netherlands).

58
02:50.036 --> 02:52.825
They also had access to the research other

59
02:53.006 --> 02:55.371
great scientists of the time, only a

60
02:55.395 --> 02:57.441
minority of whom were British.

61
02:57.465 --> 03:00.385
But it was Britain where the Scientific

62
03:00.409 --> 03:02.273
Method took hold most firmly, and where the

63
03:02.297 --> 03:05.430
Restoration’s Royal Society gave scientific

64
03:05.454 --> 03:08.310
progress a central place in society.

65
03:08.334 --> 03:12.956
The French, in contrast, were before 1789 a

66
03:12.980 --> 03:16.067
bunch of dilettante theoreticians, trying

67
03:16.091 --> 03:18.897
to get Leonhard Euler to figure out fluid

68
03:18.921 --> 03:22.428
mechanics so their Navy could move faster,

69
03:22.452 --> 03:25.494
ignoring the weed on the bottom of the

70
03:25.518 --> 03:26.977
ships.

71
03:27.001 --> 03:30.321
The Great Tew circle was a group of mostly

72
03:30.345 --> 03:33.802
young gentry intellectuals led by Lucius

73
03:33.966 --> 03:38.124
Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland, who met at his

74
03:38.148 --> 03:40.444
house in Great Tew, Oxfordshire.

75
03:40.468 --> 03:43.324
It included several people who would be

76
03:43.348 --> 03:46.204
important after the Restoration, including

77
03:46.228 --> 03:49.270
Edward Hyde, later Earl of Clarendon and

78
03:49.294 --> 03:50.931
the architect of the Restoration

79
03:50.955 --> 03:52.253
settlement.

80
03:52.277 --> 03:55.722
They opposed the absolutist rule of Charles

81
03:55.746 --> 03:57.302
I and Strafford

82
03:57.326 --> 03:59.727
and the narrow quasi-Catholic

83
03:59.751 --> 04:02.486
Anglicanism of Archbishop William Laud

84
04:02.510 --> 04:04.239
but remained staunchly

85
04:04.263 --> 04:05.683
committed both to the Church

86
04:05.707 --> 04:06.906
of England and the King

87
04:06.930 --> 04:08.707
as leader of the country.

88
04:09.769 --> 04:12.211
They differed from time to time on religion

89
04:12.235 --> 04:14.627
and other matters, but consciously took the

90
04:14.651 --> 04:16.856
view of Cicero and Erasmus that such

91
04:16.880 --> 04:20.313
differences should not mar an underlying

92
04:20.337 --> 04:22.493
friendship and might lead to truth.

93
04:22.517 --> 04:26.260
Economics was peripheral to the Great Tew

94
04:26.284 --> 04:28.835
group (although their limited economic

95
04:28.859 --> 04:31.828
ideas were to have lasting influence), but

96
04:31.852 --> 04:34.221
they strongly opposed the royal monopolies

97
04:34.245 --> 04:36.733
that hampered the economy under the early

98
04:36.757 --> 04:39.427
Stuarts and supported freedom of domestic

99
04:39.451 --> 04:43.139
trade. Since Great Tew’s thinkers objected

100
04:43.163 --> 04:45.928
to the state-imposed restrictions of the

101
04:45.952 --> 04:48.712
Tudor and early Stuart monarchy, they were

102
04:48.736 --> 04:51.219
pro-trade, at least domestically, and

103
04:51.243 --> 04:53.448
wanted to remove the remaining feudal

104
04:53.472 --> 04:55.773
restrictions on property transfer.

105
04:55.797 --> 04:58.953
Clarendon would develop these ideas during

106
04:58.977 --> 05:00.787
his time as Lord Chancellor.

107
05:00.811 --> 05:04.057
Overall, Great Tew was the birthplace of

108
05:04.081 --> 05:06.547
what I have called the Oxfordshire School

109
05:06.571 --> 05:09.663
of Economic Thought, pre-dating Adam Smith

110
05:09.687 --> 05:12.461
in its enthusiasm for free markets but

111
05:12.485 --> 05:15.091
without his enthusiasm for unilateral

112
05:15.115 --> 05:18.061
tariff abolition – I shall come back later

113
05:18.085 --> 05:21.501
to that school’s leader, Sir Dudley North.

114
05:21.525 --> 05:24.773
The East India Company had already

115
05:24.933 --> 05:27.280
established a foothold in India before

116
05:27.439 --> 05:30.996
1642, but Britain’s North American and

117
05:31.020 --> 05:33.807
Caribbean expansion was on an altogether

118
05:33.831 --> 05:35.245
different scale.

119
05:35.269 --> 05:39.381
Jamestown was colonized in 1607, with the

120
05:39.405 --> 05:41.494
addition of the first African slaves in

121
05:41.634 --> 05:45.464
1619. Plymouth was colonized in 1620.

122
05:45.488 --> 05:48.159
More significantly, a very well-backed

123
05:48.183 --> 05:51.333
settlement was
established at Boston in

124
05:51.357 --> 05:54.841
1630, including the first American college,

125
05:54.865 --> 05:57.817
Harvard, founded in 1636.

126
05:57.841 --> 06:01.643
By 1650, the settler population of the

127
06:01.667 --> 06:05.269
future United States was over 50,000,

128
06:05.293 --> 06:08.495
including about 400 African-Americans in

129
06:08.519 --> 06:11.748
Virginia, of whom 18,000 were in

130
06:11.772 --> 06:15.183
Massachusetts and 19,000 were in Virginia.

131
06:15.207 --> 06:18.923
There was especially rapid expansion of the

132
06:18.947 --> 06:21.934
North American settler population in the

133
06:21.958 --> 06:25.588
1640s, when disgruntled Cavaliers fled from

134
06:25.612 --> 06:28.559
the authoritarian Puritan regime emerging

135
06:28.583 --> 06:30.533
at home.

136
06:30.557 --> 06:33.017
The colonies’ main export was tobacco from

137
06:33.041 --> 06:35.801
Virginia -- with under 400 slaves there

138
06:35.825 --> 06:38.613
before 1650, the main workforce was

139
06:38.637 --> 06:41.375
indentured servants from British convicts

140
06:41.399 --> 06:43.604
and the impoverished.

141
06:43.628 --> 06:46.671
In the West Indies, Bermuda was colonized

142
06:46.695 --> 06:52.030
from 1612 and Barbados from 1627, exporting

143
06:52.054 --> 06:54.009
sugar from the 1640s.

144
06:54.033 --> 06:57.003
Again, the primary workforce was British

145
06:57.027 --> 06:59.487
and Irish indentured servants, although a

146
06:59.511 --> 07:01.903
British workforce did not do well in the

147
07:01.927 --> 07:03.317
Caribbean climate.

148
07:03.341 --> 07:05.824
With the Bahamas also colonized in the

149
07:05.848 --> 07:08.591
1640s, the total population of the British

150
07:08.615 --> 07:12.953
West Indies was over 40,000 by 1650.

151
07:12.977 --> 07:15.833
Although the revenues from North America

152
07:15.857 --> 07:19.364
and the Caribbean were modest before 1650,

153
07:19.388 --> 07:22.148
the level of investment and manpower there

154
07:22.172 --> 07:23.595
was already huge.

155
07:23.619 --> 07:26.239
The growth in population of Britain’s

156
07:26.263 --> 07:29.300
transatlantic colonies to almost 100,000

157
07:29.324 --> 07:31.993
gave them a potential importance far

158
07:32.017 --> 07:34.155
greater than contemporary British

159
07:34.179 --> 07:37.199
investment in India, and greater than the

160
07:37.223 --> 07:39.796
Dutch had achieved despite their huge

161
07:39.820 --> 07:42.308
investment in their East and West India

162
07:42.332 --> 07:45.183
Companies. Britain’s transatlantic

163
07:45.207 --> 07:47.899
population also dwarfed that of France,

164
07:47.923 --> 07:51.316
which in 1650 was only around 2,000 in

165
07:51.340 --> 07:54.149
Canada and 5,000 in the Caribbean.

166
07:54.777 --> 07:59.365
The Interregnum from 1649 opened up the

167
07:59.389 --> 08:01.645
British political system to new groups

168
08:01.669 --> 08:03.319
beyond the Court aristocracy.

169
08:03.343 --> 08:05.526
Ministers from working-class or

170
08:05.550 --> 08:08.496
middle-class backgrounds had existed before

171
08:08.520 --> 08:11.286
– Thomas Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell were

172
08:11.310 --> 08:13.979
both humbly born – but the political

173
08:14.003 --> 08:16.299
system’s openness to new talent became

174
08:16.323 --> 08:18.992
general, rather than limited to a monarch’s

175
08:19.016 --> 08:20.758
accidental favourites.

176
08:20.782 --> 08:24.566
The Interregnum also introduced Dutch ideas

177
08:24.590 --> 08:26.235
about secure property rights.

178
08:26.259 --> 08:29.115
Property rights are the central pillar of a

179
08:29.139 --> 08:31.905
free society and essential to a functioning

180
08:31.929 --> 08:35.152
economy – without them no fortune is safe,

181
08:35.176 --> 08:37.591
nothing can be built up except by the

182
08:37.615 --> 08:40.539
shabbiest short-term speculation, and

183
08:40.563 --> 08:43.232
long-term creation of a substantial

184
08:43.256 --> 08:44.907
business becomes impossible.

185
08:44.931 --> 08:47.250
Their importance had been recognized by

186
08:47.274 --> 08:50.016
Great Tew, but the Interregnum rulers had

187
08:50.040 --> 08:52.246
the first chance of putting this innovation

188
08:52.270 --> 08:55.030
into practice, albeit imperfectly.

189
08:55.054 --> 08:59.139
Property rights under the Tudors and early

190
08:59.258 --> 09:01.627
Stuarts were more secure than they had been

191
09:01.651 --> 09:04.411
– in the Middle Ages any local lord with a

192
09:04.435 --> 09:06.827
band of thugs could dispossess you – but

193
09:06.851 --> 09:08.961
they were still subject to the whims of the

194
09:08.985 --> 09:11.937
monarch – as the monastic orders discovered

195
09:11.961 --> 09:13.669
under Henry VIII.

196
09:13.693 --> 09:16.786
The Dutch beginning around 1580 were the

197
09:16.810 --> 09:19.088
first in Europe to discover that secure

198
09:19.112 --> 09:21.686
property rights made all kinds of new

199
09:21.710 --> 09:24.288
enterprises possible and made themselves

200
09:24.312 --> 09:26.258
rich with this discovery.

201
09:26.282 --> 09:29.047
In the Interregnum, Britain finally learned

202
09:29.071 --> 09:31.627
the same overwhelmingly important lesson,

203
09:31.651 --> 09:35.826
and after 1660 it was codified into law and

204
09:35.850 --> 09:37.942
became the centrepiece of British

205
09:37.966 --> 09:40.539
commercial wealth and eventually industrial

206
09:40.563 --> 09:43.515
growth. Thomas Newcomen could not have

207
09:43.539 --> 09:48.315
spent the ten years 1702-12 and a large

208
09:48.339 --> 09:51.318
portion of his income as an ironmonger in

209
09:51.342 --> 09:54.102
perfecting his steam engine, if he had not

210
09:54.126 --> 09:56.422
been confident that his ironmongery would

211
09:56.446 --> 09:58.912
be secure and his invention would be

212
09:59.048 --> 10:01.808
protected, albeit under Thomas Savery’s

213
10:01.832 --> 10:04.598
already existing patent.

214
10:04.622 --> 10:07.291
The other legacy of the Interregnum was the

215
10:07.315 --> 10:10.635
Navigation Act of 1651, some version of

216
10:10.659 --> 10:13.232
which was in force for the next 200 years,

217
10:13.256 --> 10:15.858
until final repeal in 1849.

218
10:15.882 --> 10:19.429
This followed the principles of Thomas Mun,

219
10:19.453 --> 10:22.614
of whom more below, by banning foreign

220
10:22.638 --> 10:25.557
ships from transporting goods from Asia,

221
10:25.581 --> 10:27.837
Africa or America to England or its

222
10:27.861 --> 10:30.976
colonies. Only ships with an English owner,

223
10:31.000 --> 10:34.038
master and a majority English crew were

224
10:34.062 --> 10:37.277
acceptable. It allowed European ships to

225
10:37.301 --> 10:39.400
ship their own country’s products to

226
10:39.424 --> 10:42.029
Britain but banned shipment to England in

227
10:42.053 --> 10:44.627
European ships of any goods from a third

228
10:44.651 --> 10:46.205
European country.

229
10:46.229 --> 10:49.018
It was aimed primarily at the Dutch and

230
10:49.042 --> 10:51.501
essentially banned Dutch ships from

231
10:51.525 --> 10:53.917
shipping goods to England, since there were

232
10:53.941 --> 10:56.260
few goods produced in the Netherlands that

233
10:56.284 --> 10:58.744
were competitive in the English market).

234
10:58.768 --> 11:02.371
In 1660, King Charles II returned,

235
11:02.395 --> 11:05.385
accompanied by Clarendon as Lord Chancellor

236
11:06.060 --> 11:08.377
In their first summer, the Convention

237
11:08.401 --> 11:11.284
Parliament passed legislation that would be

238
11:11.308 --> 11:14.538
absolutely crucial to the future Industrial

239
11:14.562 --> 11:17.067
Revolution: the Tenures Abolition Act,

240
11:17.091 --> 11:18.532
1660.

241
11:18.556 --> 11:21.690
This abolished the Court of Wards and

242
11:21.714 --> 11:25.058
Liveries, abolished tenancies in capite and

243
11:25.171 --> 11:28.582
by knights-service, and purveyance.

244
11:28.606 --> 11:33.204
By doing so, it eliminated many feudal dues

245
11:33.228 --> 11:36.107
and service obligations that had been due

246
11:36.131 --> 11:37.499
to the Crown.

247
11:37.523 --> 11:40.634
Most important, it eliminated the feudal

248
11:40.658 --> 11:43.423
restrictions on land holding, making land

249
11:43.447 --> 11:46.207
an asset that could be freely bought, sold

250
11:46.231 --> 11:47.882
and mortgaged.

251
11:47.906 --> 11:50.542
Thereby, it freed up enormous amounts of

252
11:50.566 --> 11:52.640
capital that could be used to finance

253
11:52.664 --> 11:56.148
industrialization. By creating a free

254
11:56.172 --> 11:58.746
market in land, it gave Britain an

255
11:58.770 --> 12:01.371
advantage that other European countries all

256
12:01.395 --> 12:03.578
lacked, even a century later.

257
12:03.602 --> 12:07.199
The free market in land, when combined with

258
12:07.223 --> 12:10.079
the local country banks that grew up after

259
12:10.103 --> 12:13.627
1750, played a crucial role in getting the

260
12:13.651 --> 12:16.303
first industrializations off the ground –

261
12:16.327 --> 12:19.364
the country banks could grant mortgages on

262
12:19.388 --> 12:21.990
the land of local farmers and gentry, thus

263
12:22.014 --> 12:24.310
making capital available for new industrial

264
12:24.334 --> 12:25.866
projects.

265
12:25.890 --> 12:29.860
Section 14 of this Act also imposed an

266
12:29.884 --> 12:31.462
excise duty

267
12:31.486 --> 12:34.596
on tea, coffee, sherbet and chocolate. By

268
12:34.620 --> 12:36.922
shifting state revenues to these new

269
12:36.946 --> 12:39.428
sources, Clarendon performed a vital

270
12:39.452 --> 12:41.844
service for the country’s fiscal future.

271
12:41.868 --> 12:45.188
Instead of being fixed like previous taxes,

272
12:45.212 --> 12:48.714
customs and excise duties on these newly

273
12:48.738 --> 12:51.316
consumed products (as well as on tobacco

274
12:51.340 --> 12:54.010
and sugar, produced in Britain’s American

275
12:54.034 --> 12:57.099
and West Indian colonies) increased with

276
12:57.123 --> 12:59.556
the increase in national wealth, trade,

277
12:59.580 --> 13:01.903
“luxury” and consumption of these expensive

278
13:01.927 --> 13:03.946
imported goods.

279
13:03.970 --> 13:06.735
These new revenues formed the basis of

280
13:06.759 --> 13:10.516
Britain’s taxation system until the 1840s;

281
13:10.540 --> 13:15.652
by 1792 customs and excise duties were

282
13:15.676 --> 13:19.828
producing 69% of Britain’s revenue of £18.7

283
13:19.852 --> 13:24.383
million, itself some 15 times the revenue

284
13:24.407 --> 13:27.727
in 1661 (in pounds whose value had changed

285
13:27.751 --> 13:29.119
little).

286
13:29.143 --> 13:31.972
The Restoration saw a huge expansion of

287
13:31.996 --> 13:34.319
British trade, with corresponding benefit

288
13:34.343 --> 13:35.920
to the Exchequer.

289
13:35.944 --> 13:38.127
A newly aggressive approach to

290
13:38.151 --> 13:40.356
international trade was accompanied by a

291
13:40.380 --> 13:43.610
sharp expansion and professionalization of

292
13:43.634 --> 13:45.859
the Royal Navy led by Charles

293
13:45.883 --> 13:48.175
II and hist brother James.

294
13:48.199 --> 13:51.153
It was in this period that Britain became a

295
13:51.177 --> 13:53.546
leader in world trade, with military

296
13:53.570 --> 13:55.402
resources to back it.

297
13:55.426 --> 13:58.192
Sugar and tobacco were now produced in

298
13:58.216 --> 14:00.721
British colonies in the West Indies and

299
14:00.745 --> 14:03.455
America. Sugar used slave labour, because

300
14:03.479 --> 14:05.808
the West Indies climate was intolerable to

301
14:05.832 --> 14:07.850
the light-skinned British.

302
14:07.874 --> 14:10.967
However, tobacco used very few slaves until

303
14:10.991 --> 14:14.679
around 1690, relying instead on indentured

304
14:14.703 --> 14:17.600
servants shipped over from British jails.

305
14:17.624 --> 14:20.389
The revenue effect of these two products

306
14:20.413 --> 14:21.408
was huge.

307
14:21.432 --> 14:24.474
Tobacco was already producing excise duties

308
14:24.498 --> 14:28.560
of £100,000 a year, 10% of total budget

309
14:28.584 --> 14:31.626
revenues, by the time of Bacon’s Rebellion

310
14:31.650 --> 14:35.034
in 1676, while sugar went on growing

311
14:35.058 --> 14:37.823
through the 18th century so that its duties

312
14:37.847 --> 14:40.266
were a fifth of greatly enlarged total

313
14:40.290 --> 14:42.213
budget revenue by 1792.

314
14:42.237 --> 14:45.400
These new revenues made national budgeting

315
14:45.740 --> 14:48.069
easier; after the Great Stop of the

316
14:48.093 --> 14:51.781
Exchequer in 1672 the Treasury ran

317
14:51.805 --> 14:55.002
surpluses overall in the next 15 years of

318
14:55.026 --> 14:59.493
peace – only after 1688 with William III’s

319
14:59.517 --> 15:02.277
expensive wars did the National Debt become

320
15:02.301 --> 15:03.228
necessary.

321
15:03.252 --> 15:07.477
Coffee, tea and chocolate also began to be

322
15:07.501 --> 15:09.893
imported into Britain in quantity in the

323
15:09.917 --> 15:11.194
Restoration period.

324
15:11.218 --> 15:13.424
These products were not produced in British

325
15:13.448 --> 15:16.768
colonies (tea was Chinese, not Indian) and

326
15:16.792 --> 15:19.802
so did not produce huge excise revenues

327
15:19.826 --> 15:23.082
(the East India Company’s surplus of tea in

328
15:23.106 --> 15:26.517
1773 was a cause of the notorious Boston

329
15:26.541 --> 15:27.818
Tea Party).

330
15:27.842 --> 15:30.885
However, coffee had a big cultural effect

331
15:30.909 --> 15:34.784
starting in the Restoration period, by

332
15:34.808 --> 15:37.386
spawning coffee houses where conversation

333
15:37.410 --> 15:38.988
and deal-making mixed.

334
15:39.012 --> 15:42.186
Jonathan’s, founded in 1680, became the

335
15:42.210 --> 15:46.321
Stock Exchange; Lloyd’s, founded in 1686

336
15:46.345 --> 15:49.948
became the world’s insurance market and

337
15:49.972 --> 15:54.406
Garraway’s founded in 1657 introduced tea

338
15:54.430 --> 15:56.981
to Britain and then became a leading

339
15:57.005 --> 15:59.674
commodities exchange, holding the Hudson

340
15:59.698 --> 16:04.343
Bay Company’s first sale of furs in 1671.

341
16:04.808 --> 16:08.592
(The Hudson’s Bay Company, founded in 1670

342
16:08.616 --> 16:10.821
by the King’s cousin Prince Rupert of the

343
16:10.845 --> 16:15.189
Rhine, at one point owned 1.5 million

344
16:15.213 --> 16:18.437
square miles of Canada, and still exists as

345
16:18.461 --> 16:19.972
a retail chain.)

346
16:20.249 --> 16:23.360
Next, the Restoration period marked the

347
16:23.384 --> 16:25.800
birth of banking.

348
16:25.986 --> 16:29.861
Before 1660, banking services had been

349
16:29.885 --> 16:32.741
carried out by two groups: goldsmiths and

350
16:32.765 --> 16:36.945
scriveners. Goldsmiths acted as

351
16:36.969 --> 16:39.616
depositories for gold and silver, forming

352
16:39.640 --> 16:42.372
it into tableware as desired and lending

353
16:42.396 --> 16:45.280
against gold or silver tableware and other

354
16:45.304 --> 16:47.068
artefacts deposited with them.

355
16:47.092 --> 16:50.480
Because they dealt in such luxury items,

356
16:50.504 --> 16:53.173
their clientele was largely limited to the

357
16:53.197 --> 16:55.589
very rich, especially Londoners.

358
16:55.613 --> 17:00.608
Scriveners were drafters (and, before the

359
17:00.632 --> 17:03.018
invention of printing, writers) of

360
17:03.042 --> 17:06.362
documents, with skill in legal wording but

361
17:06.386 --> 17:09.292
without the specialized legal practice of

362
17:09.316 --> 17:12.586
attorneys. They became specialists in land

363
17:12.610 --> 17:15.280
transactions and documents, having contacts

364
17:15.304 --> 17:18.810
at the Mayor’s Court in London where titles

365
17:18.834 --> 17:20.175
could be checked.

366
17:20.199 --> 17:22.709
They had a good period in the early 17th

367
17:22.733 --> 17:25.521
century because of a high volume of land

368
17:25.545 --> 17:29.306
transfers – the poet John Milton’s father

369
17:29.330 --> 17:32.464
was a scrivener and rich enough to keep

370
17:32.488 --> 17:34.693
Milton comfortably until his death –

371
17:34.717 --> 17:38.128
writing poems about Paradise was not very

372
17:38.152 --> 17:40.917
lucrative, earning Milton only £30 for

373
17:40.941 --> 17:42.773
several years’ work.

374
17:42.797 --> 17:45.653
Scriveners’ clients were mostly country

375
17:45.677 --> 17:49.020
landowners, but not the very rich – money

376
17:49.044 --> 17:52.081
transfers to London were sent with a sheep

377
17:52.105 --> 17:55.708
drover bringing his flock to London – sheep

378
17:55.732 --> 17:58.101
drovers, travelling in groups and with

379
17:58.125 --> 18:00.257
sheepdogs, were pretty safe from

380
18:00.281 --> 18:01.536
highwaymen.

381
18:01.560 --> 18:05.434
After 1660, both groups began to move into

382
18:05.458 --> 18:07.777
true banking, though goldsmiths were

383
18:07.801 --> 18:11.472
knocked back by the 1672 Great Stop of the

384
18:11.496 --> 18:14.538
Exchequer (scriveners, without many Court

385
18:14.562 --> 18:17.346
contacts, did not lend much to government).

386
18:18.066 --> 18:22.432
Goldsmith banks included Hoare’s founded in

387
18:22.456 --> 18:27.264
1672, Child’s founded in 1671 and a little

388
18:27.288 --> 18:30.234
later Coutts, founded in 1692.

389
18:30.258 --> 18:33.828
The biggest scrivener bank was Clayton &amp;

390
18:33.852 --> 18:36.458
Morris, which grew out of a scrivening

391
18:36.482 --> 18:39.242
business and became a bank from 1658,

392
18:39.266 --> 18:42.004
beginning by lending money to Royalist

393
18:42.028 --> 18:44.975
plotters, notably George Monck, who

394
18:44.999 --> 18:47.322
restored the King with his Coldstream

395
18:47.346 --> 18:49.184
Guards and became Duke of Albemarle.

396
18:49.208 --> 18:52.432
Clayton &amp; Morris built a nationwide deposit

397
18:52.456 --> 18:55.548
and mortgage business, their largest client

398
18:55.572 --> 18:57.591
being the hugely landed but heavily

399
18:57.615 --> 19:00.144
indebted 2nd Duke of Buckingham.

400
19:00.168 --> 19:03.765
While Clayton &amp; Morris did not survive Sir

401
19:03.789 --> 19:07.760
Robert Clayton’s death in 1707, with its

402
19:07.784 --> 19:10.266
mortgage lending, deposit taking and

403
19:10.290 --> 19:14.188
primarily rural gentry clientele it set the

404
19:14.212 --> 19:16.490
pattern for the country banks of the next

405
19:16.514 --> 19:17.997
century.

406
19:18.370 --> 19:21.290
The Restoration period was fertile with

407
19:21.314 --> 19:23.733
economists, a discipline that had few

408
19:23.757 --> 19:25.498
previous adherents.

409
19:25.522 --> 19:28.005
These anticipated much of Adam Smith’s

410
19:28.029 --> 19:29.584
thinking by a century.

411
19:29.608 --> 19:33.024
Thomas Mun’s mercantilist classic

412
19:33.048 --> 19:36.786
“England’s Treasure by Forraign Trade” is

413
19:36.810 --> 19:40.730
something of a cheat, having been written

414
19:40.754 --> 19:44.074
in the 1620s, but it was first published in

415
19:44.098 --> 19:47.418
1664 and was highly influential on

416
19:47.442 --> 19:49.557
Restoration economic thinking.

417
19:49.581 --> 19:52.618
Mun was a Director of the early East India

418
19:52.642 --> 19:55.776
Company; his thesis was that trade should

419
19:55.800 --> 19:59.556
be organized to store up “Treasure” – gold

420
19:59.580 --> 20:02.209
and silver – thus making the state powerful

421
20:02.233 --> 20:03.578
and happy.

422
20:03.602 --> 20:05.717
This was a very sensible approach in the

423
20:05.741 --> 20:08.060
17th century, when monarchs were

424
20:08.084 --> 20:10.640
chronically short of cash and the cost of

425
20:10.664 --> 20:12.405
warfare had escalated.

426
20:12.429 --> 20:14.748
It was realized through the trades in

427
20:14.772 --> 20:17.418
tobacco, sugar, coffee, tea and chocolate,

428
20:17.442 --> 20:19.461
as I mentioned before.

429
20:19.485 --> 20:22.432
Its success made the last years of the

430
20:22.456 --> 20:25.271
Restoration period fiscally much happier

431
20:25.295 --> 20:27.728
than the early years, let alone the

432
20:27.752 --> 20:30.234
cash-starved monarchy of James I and

433
20:30.258 --> 20:33.301
Charles I – it also provided the money to

434
20:33.325 --> 20:34.994
build up the Navy.

435
20:35.527 --> 20:39.152
Sir William Petty made his fortune

436
20:39.176 --> 20:41.444
surveying Ireland for the Cromwellian

437
20:41.468 --> 20:44.538
clearances, acquiring a substantial fortune

438
20:44.562 --> 20:48.533
thereby. After the Restoration, he helped

439
20:48.557 --> 20:51.617
found the Royal Society, then retired to

440
20:51.641 --> 20:54.079
his new Irish estates and pondered on

441
20:54.103 --> 20:56.890
economics. His “Political Arithmetic”

442
20:56.914 --> 21:01.282
written in 1676 but published in 1690,

443
21:01.396 --> 21:03.765
pioneered the collection of economic

444
21:03.789 --> 21:06.431
statistics, developing the first national

445
21:06.455 --> 21:07.760
income accounts.

446
21:07.784 --> 21:10.380
He also pioneered the doctrine of

447
21:10.404 --> 21:13.080
laissez-faire, postulating that the economy

448
21:13.193 --> 21:15.562
develops best when government meddles

449
21:15.586 --> 21:16.513
least.

450
21:16.537 --> 21:21.804
Sir Dudley North was the younger son of an

451
21:21.828 --> 21:24.293
impoverished Royalist peer, who spent 20

452
21:24.317 --> 21:26.426
years in Turkey making a fortune as a

453
21:26.450 --> 21:30.053
merchant. He returned to England in 1680,

454
21:30.077 --> 21:32.996
entered Parliament as a Tory and was

455
21:33.020 --> 21:36.085
Chairman of Ways and Means in the 1685

456
21:36.109 --> 21:38.314
Parliament, where he stamped out several

457
21:38.338 --> 21:42.682
frauds in the Revenue and warned against

458
21:42.706 --> 21:43.820
excessive money printing.

459
21:43.844 --> 21:47.605
His 1691 “Discourses upon Trade” published

460
21:47.629 --> 21:50.348
after his death but containing ideas from

461
21:50.372 --> 21:53.546
his period of political power, anticipated

462
21:53.570 --> 21:57.173
Smith and Cantillon in its enthusiasm for

463
21:57.197 --> 22:00.070
free trade and warned against government

464
22:00.094 --> 22:03.861
regulation: “Thus we may labour to hedge in

465
22:03.885 --> 22:08.100
the Cuckow, but in vain; for no People ever

466
22:08.124 --> 22:10.940
yet grew rich by Policies, but it is Peace,

467
22:10.964 --> 22:14.824
Industry and Freedom that brings Trade and

468
22:14.848 --> 22:16.977
Wealth, and nothing else.”

469
22:18.279 --> 22:21.785
Mun solved the principal problem of 17th

470
22:21.809 --> 22:23.942
century governments, but the

471
22:23.966 --> 22:27.359
future-oriented Petty and North pointed the

472
22:27.383 --> 22:29.515
economic way ahead clearly.

473
22:29.539 --> 22:32.185
Their insights set the policy framework

474
22:32.209 --> 22:34.047
that made the Industrial Revolution

475
22:34.071 --> 22:35.390
possible.

476
22:36.227 --> 22:39.337
The Restoration period also saw the birth

477
22:39.361 --> 22:40.825
of political parties.

478
22:40.849 --> 22:44.374
Their names emerged from the 1678-81

479
22:44.398 --> 22:47.417
Exclusion Crisis, but their ideas predated

480
22:47.441 --> 22:49.065
that crisis.

481
22:49.089 --> 22:52.176
The Whig party was the natural home for

482
22:52.200 --> 22:54.201
supporters of the Commonwealth, though it

483
22:54.225 --> 22:55.780
was broader than that.

484
22:55.804 --> 22:58.214
Its primary base was the high landed

485
22:58.238 --> 23:00.953
aristocracy, who resented Royal power,

486
23:00.977 --> 23:04.047
together with the cosmopolitan City of

487
23:04.071 --> 23:07.131
London, home of the goldsmith-bankers who

488
23:07.155 --> 23:09.870
propped up the Whig aristocrats’ fortunes.

489
23:09.894 --> 23:12.313
Before 1800 the Whigs were highly

490
23:12.337 --> 23:14.911
protectionist, passing the Trade with

491
23:14.935 --> 23:19.115
France Act 1678, prohibiting such trade

492
23:19.139 --> 23:20.761
even though Britain was at peace with

493
23:20.785 --> 23:22.721
France (they were to continue such

494
23:22.745 --> 23:25.872
protectionism under Walpole).

495
23:26.660 --> 23:30.539
The “Whig Martyrs” of 1683, who attempted

496
23:31.026 --> 23:33.859
to assassinate the King, included one high

497
23:33.883 --> 23:36.957
aristocrat, William Russell whose brother

498
23:36.981 --> 23:38.992
I think became the
Duke of Bedford and a

499
23:40.011 --> 23:42.030
Commonwealth-supporting agitator and

500
23:42.054 --> 23:45.006
polemicist, Algernon Sidney; they were

501
23:45.030 --> 23:47.699
sentenced to death by a jury chosen by Sir

502
23:47.723 --> 23:49.301
Dudley North.

503
23:49.325 --> 23:51.971
Since the goldsmith-bankers did not finance

504
23:51.995 --> 23:54.574
industry, the Whig party was devoted to

505
23:54.598 --> 23:58.632
wars, Imperial exploitation and slavery;

506
23:58.656 --> 24:01.229
they were generally opposed to the forces

507
24:01.253 --> 24:03.259
that produced the Industrial Revolution.

508
24:03.283 --> 24:07.113
To be fair, the Whig hostility to monarchy

509
24:07.137 --> 24:10.174
did produce one liberating result: the

510
24:10.198 --> 24:13.427
Habeas Corpus Act of 1678, observed more

511
24:13.451 --> 24:15.807
rigorously in its early years than it is

512
24:15.831 --> 24:17.442
today.

513
24:18.189 --> 24:20.575
The Tory party grew out of Clarendon’s

514
24:20.599 --> 24:23.892
Restoration Settlement; his second son

515
24:23.916 --> 24:26.431
Laurence Hyde, Earl of Rochester was its

516
24:26.455 --> 24:27.727
main founder.

517
24:27.751 --> 24:31.258
It represented the great rural mass of the

518
24:31.282 --> 24:33.951
country, devoted to the monarchy and the

519
24:33.975 --> 24:34.975
Church of England.

520
24:34.999 --> 24:38.133
Tories favoured free trade, being

521
24:38.157 --> 24:40.730
influenced by Sir Dudley North and also

522
24:40.754 --> 24:43.429
peace and low taxes, since their members

523
24:43.453 --> 24:45.935
paid most of the taxes without having the

524
24:45.959 --> 24:48.833
liquid means of the Whig high aristocracy

525
24:48.857 --> 24:51.135
or the “monied interest” of the City of

526
24:51.159 --> 24:53.801
London While the goldsmith-bankers were

527
24:53.825 --> 24:56.452
Whig, the scrivener-bankers and their

528
24:56.476 --> 24:58.938
eventual successors the country banks were

529
24:58.962 --> 25:01.881
mostly Tory, since their business was based

530
25:01.905 --> 25:04.902
on land and local knowledge, not money

531
25:04.926 --> 25:06.294
market dealing.

532
25:06.318 --> 25:09.338
With its openness to global trade and its

533
25:09.362 --> 25:12.218
localization, the Tory party was well

534
25:12.242 --> 25:14.324
suited to assist in the birth of

535
25:14.348 --> 25:16.677
industrialization, from the Devon

536
25:16.701 --> 25:19.208
ironmonger Thomas Newcomen onwards.

537
25:20.481 --> 25:23.274
The final innovation of the Restoration

538
25:23.298 --> 25:26.081
period and perhaps the most important for

539
25:26.105 --> 25:28.378
Britain’s long-term future, was the

540
25:28.402 --> 25:31.785
founding of the Royal Society in 1662.

541
25:31.809 --> 25:35.439
This propagated Bacon’s Scientific Method,

542
25:35.463 --> 25:38.710
making it a paradigm that innovators of

543
25:38.734 --> 25:41.850
whatever educational level could use in

544
25:41.874 --> 25:44.261
developing and improving their machines.

545
25:44.285 --> 25:47.050
In the Restoration period it also produced

546
25:47.074 --> 25:49.581
a stellar collection of scientists and

547
25:49.694 --> 25:52.737
other intellects: Robert Boyle, Christopher

548
25:52.761 --> 25:56.613
Wren, Robert Hooke, John Flamsteed, Edmond

549
25:56.637 --> 26:00.330
Halley and most important Isaac Newton, who

550
26:00.354 --> 26:02.933
between them revolutionized science and

551
26:02.957 --> 26:05.439
made Britain a leading scientific power for

552
26:05.463 --> 26:07.205
the next three centuries.

553
26:07.229 --> 26:09.547
The Society’s alumni’s scientific

554
26:09.571 --> 26:12.218
discoveries themselves stimulated

555
26:12.242 --> 26:15.375
industrialization; they also had an effect

556
26:15.399 --> 26:17.887
in industrialization’s more practical

557
26:17.911 --> 26:21.413
needs. For example, Thomas Tompion, a

558
26:21.437 --> 26:24.293
protégé of Hooke, was Britain’s leading

559
26:24.317 --> 26:26.709
clock maker of the period, greatly

560
26:26.733 --> 26:29.215
improving engineering tolerances in metal

561
26:29.239 --> 26:31.931
machinery, a skill that would be vital to

562
26:31.955 --> 26:34.071
future industrial progress.

563
26:34.903 --> 26:37.855
Intellectually, economically and

564
26:37.879 --> 26:40.735
politically, the Restoration period was

565
26:40.759 --> 26:43.429
essential to producing the Industrial

566
26:43.453 --> 26:46.927
Revolution. During this period that Britain

567
26:46.951 --> 26:49.743
became different from every other European

568
26:49.767 --> 26:52.714
economy, with better property rights, freer

569
26:52.738 --> 26:56.335
domestic trade and superior scientific

570
26:56.359 --> 26:59.147
education. These differences led to faster

571
26:59.171 --> 27:02.186
economic growth and eventually, to changes

572
27:02.210 --> 27:04.161
never before seen in the history of the

573
27:04.185 --> 27:07.295
world. Charles II and the Earl of

574
27:07.319 --> 27:09.802
Clarendon, the Restoration period’s

575
27:09.826 --> 27:13.146
founders, deserve our utmost gratitude and

576
27:13.170 --> 27:14.275
recognition.

577
27:15.282 --> 27:17.605
Thank you very much for listening.

578
