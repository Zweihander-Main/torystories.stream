## Technologies used:

-   Gatsby (v4)
-   TypeScript
-   GraphQL + Typegen
-   TailwindCSS
-   Jest + Linting Runners
-   Cypress + Axe
-   Github Actions (E2E testing) + Husky pre-commit hooks
-   NetlifyCMS + Netlify

## Dev workflow

### Notes:

-   Netlify builds from `netlify`
    -   `netlify` branch is protected from push/merge without E2E test passing
    -   NetlifyCMS and netlify preview deploys working from `master` branch

### Workflow for development:

1. Pre-commit hooks run on code: all jest tests and lint runners
2. Push to `master` branch
3. E2E tests run on new code
4. If passed, branch pushed into `netlify`

### Workflow for NetlifyCMS:

1. PR created in `master`
2. Preview deploys run on PR
3. PR manually merged or merged through UI
4. E2E tests run on new code
5. If passed, branch pushed into `netlify`
